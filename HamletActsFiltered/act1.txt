 HAMLET, A little kin less kind. Not so, lord; I much sun. Ay, madam, common. "Seems," madam? Nay, is. I know "seems." 'Tis alone inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits solemn black, Nor windy suspiration forced breath, No, fruitful river eye, Nor dejected havior visage, Together forms, moods, shapes grief, That denote truly. These indeed "seem," For actions man might play; But I within passes show, These trappings suits woe. I shall best obey you, madam. O, too, sullied flesh would melt, Thaw, resolve dew, Or Everlasting fixed His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God, God, How weary, stale, flat, unprofitable Seem uses world! Fie 't, ah fie! 'Tis unweeded garden That grows seed. Things rank gross nature Possess merely. That come this: But two months dead--nay, much, two. So excellent king, Hyperion satyr; loving mother That might beteem winds heaven Visit face roughly. Heaven Earth, Must I remember? Why, would hang As increase appetite grown By fed on. And yet, within month (Let think 't; frailty, thy name woman!), A little month, ere shoes old With followed poor father's body, Like Niobe, tears--why she, even (O God, beast wants discourse reason Would mourned longer!), married uncle, My father's brother, like father Than I Hercules. Within month, Ere yet salt unrighteous tears Had left flushing galled eyes, She married. O, wicked speed, post With dexterity incestuous sheets! It not, cannot come good. But break, heart, I must hold tongue. I glad see well. Horatio--or I forget myself! Sir, good friend. I'll change name you. And make Wittenberg, Horatio?-- Marcellus? I glad see you. Good even, sir.-- But what, faith, make Wittenberg? I would hear enemy say so, Nor shall ear violence To make truster report Against yourself. I know truant. But affair Elsinore? We'll teach drink deep ere depart. I prithee, mock me, fellow student. I think see mother's wedding. Thrift, thrift, Horatio. The funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth marriage tables. Would I met dearest foe heaven Or ever I seen day, Horatio! My father--methinks I see father. In mind's eye, Horatio. He man. Take all, I shall look upon like again. Saw who? The King father? For God's love, let hear! But this? Did speak it? 'Tis strange. Indeed, sirs, troubles me. Hold watch tonight? Armed, say you? From top toe? Then saw face? What, looked frowningly? Pale red? And fixed eyes upon you? I would I there. Very like. Stayed long? His beard grizzled, no? I watch tonight. Perchance 'twill walk again. If assume noble father's person, I'll speak it, though hell gape And bid hold peace. I pray all, If hitherto concealed sight, Let tenable silence still; And whatsomever else shall hap tonight, Give understanding tongue. I requite loves. So fare well. Upon platform, 'twixt eleven twelve, I'll visit you. Your loves, mine you. Farewell. My father's spirit--in arms! All well. I doubt foul play. Would night come! Till then, sit still, soul. Foul deeds rise, Though earth o'erwhelm them, men's eyes. The air bites shrewdly; cold. What hour now? The King doth wake tonight takes rouse, Keeps wassail, swagg'ring upspring reels; And, drains draughts Rhenish down, The kettledrum trumpet thus bray The triumph pledge. Ay, marry, 't, But, mind, though I native And manner born, custom More honored breach observance. This heavy-headed revel east west Makes us traduced taxed nations. They clepe us drunkards swinish phrase Soil addition. And, indeed, takes From achievements, though performed height, The pith marrow attribute. So oft chances particular men That vicious mole nature them, As birth (wherein guilty, Since nature cannot choose origin), By o'ergrowth complexion (Oft breaking pales forts reason), Or habit much o'erleavens The form plausive manners--that men, Carrying, I say, stamp one defect, Being nature's livery fortune's star, His virtues else, pure grace, As infinite man may undergo, Shall general censure take corruption From particular fault. The dram evil Doth noble substance doubt To scandal. Angels ministers grace, defend us! Be thou spirit health goblin damned, Bring thee airs heaven blasts hell, Be thy intents wicked charitable, Thou com'st questionable shape That I speak thee. I'll call thee "Hamlet," "King," "Father," "Royal Dane." O, answer me! Let burst ignorance, tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed death, Have burst cerements; sepulcher, Wherein saw thee quietly interred, Hath oped ponderous marble jaws To cast thee again. What may mean That thou, dead corse, complete steel, Revisits thus glimpses moon, Making night hideous, fools nature So horridly shake disposition With thoughts beyond reaches souls? Say, this? Wherefore? What do? It speak. Then I follow it. Why, fear? I set life pin's fee. And soul, that, Being thing immortal itself? It waves forth again. I'll follow it. It waves still.--Go on, I'll follow thee. Hold hands. My fate cries And makes petty arture body As hardy Nemean lion's nerve. Still I called. Unhand me, gentlemen. By heaven, I'll make ghost lets me! I say, away!--Go on. I'll follow thee. Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak. I'll go further. I will. Alas, poor ghost! Speak. I bound hear. What? O God! Murder? Haste know 't, I, wings swift As meditation thoughts love, May sweep revenge. O, prophetic soul! My uncle! O host heaven! O Earth! What else? And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, heart, And you, sinews, grow instant old, But bear stiffly up. Remember thee? Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds seat In distracted globe. Remember thee? Yea, table memory I'll wipe away trivial, fond records, All saws books, forms, pressures past, That youth observation copied there, And thy commandment alone shall live Within book volume brain, Unmixed baser matter. Yes, heaven! O pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables--meet I set That one may smile smile villain. At least I sure may Denmark. So, uncle, are. Now word. It "adieu, adieu, remember me." I sworn 't. So it. Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come! O, wonderful! No, reveal it. How say you, then? Would heart man think it? But secret? There's never villain dwelling Denmark But he's arrant knave. Why, right, right. And so, without circumstance all, I hold fit shake hands part, You, business desire shall point (For every man hath business desire, Such is), poor part, I go pray. I sorry offend you, heartily; Yes, faith, heartily. Yes, Saint Patrick, is, Horatio, And much offense, too. Touching vision here, It honest ghost--that let tell you. For desire know us, O'ermaster 't may. And now, good friends, As friends, scholars, soldiers, Give one poor request. Never make known seen tonight. Nay, swear 't. Upon sword. Indeed, upon sword, indeed. Ha, ha, boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there, truepenny? Come on, hear fellow cellarage. Consent swear. Never speak seen, Swear sword. Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift ground. Come hither, gentlemen, And lay hands upon sword. Swear sword Never speak heard. Well said, old mole. Canst work i' th' earth fast?-- A worthy pioner! Once remove, good friends. And therefore stranger give welcome. There things heaven earth, Horatio, Than dreamt philosophy. But come. Here, before, never, help mercy, How strange odd some'er I bear (As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put antic disposition on) That you, times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumbered thus, headshake, Or pronouncing doubtful phrase, As "Well, well, know," "We could would," Or "If list speak," "There might," Or ambiguous giving-out, note That know aught me--this swear, So grace mercy need help you. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit.--So, gentlemen, With love I commend you, And poor man Hamlet May t' express love friending you, God willing, shall lack. Let us go together, And still fingers lips, I pray. The time joint. O cursed spite That ever I born set right! Nay, come, let's go together.
