 To be--that question: Whether 'tis nobler mind suffer The slings arrows outrageous fortune, Or take arms sea troubles And, opposing, end them. To die, sleep-- No more--and sleep say end The heartache thousand natural shocks That flesh heir to--'tis consummation Devoutly wished. To die, sleep-- To sleep, perchance dream. Ay, there's rub, For sleep death dreams may come, When shuffled mortal coil, Must give us pause. There's respect That makes calamity long life. For would bear whips scorns time, Th' oppressor's wrong, proud man's contumely, The pangs despised love, law's delay, The insolence office, spurns That patient merit th' unworthy takes, When might quietus make With bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, To grunt sweat weary life, But dread something death, The undiscovered country whose bourn No traveler returns, puzzles And makes us rather bear ills Than fly others know of? Thus conscience make cowards us all, And thus native hue resolution Is sicklied o'er pale cast thought, And enterprises great pitch moment With regard currents turn awry And lose name action.--Soft now, The fair Ophelia.--Nymph, thy orisons Be sins remembered. I humbly thank you, well. No, I. I never gave aught. Ha, ha, honest? Are fair? That honest fair, honesty admit discourse beauty. Ay, truly, power beauty sooner transform honesty bawd force honesty translate beauty likeness. This sometime paradox, time gives proof. I love once. You believed me, virtue cannot inoculate old stock shall relish it. I loved not. Get thee nunnery. Why wouldst thou breeder sinners? I indifferent honest, yet I could accuse things better mother borne me: I proud, revengeful, ambitious, offenses beck I thoughts put in, imagination give shape, time act in. What fellows I crawling earth heaven? We arrant knaves all; believe none us. Go thy ways nunnery. Where's father? Let doors shut upon may play fool nowhere 's house. Farewell. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee plague thy dowry: thou chaste ice, pure snow, thou shalt escape calumny. Get thee nunnery, farewell. Or thou wilt needs marry, marry fool, wise men know well enough monsters make them. To nunnery, go, quickly too. Farewell. I heard paintings too, well enough. God hath given one face, make another. You jig amble, lisp; nickname God's creatures make wantonness ignorance. Go to, I'll 't. It hath made mad. I say marriage. Those married already, one, shall live. The rest shall keep are. To nunnery, go. Speak speech, I pray you, I pronounced you, trippingly tongue; mouth it, many players do, I lief town-crier spoke lines. Nor saw air much hand, thus, use gently; torrent, tempest, and, I may say, whirlwind passion, must acquire beget temperance may give smoothness. O, offends soul hear robustious, periwig-pated fellow tear passion tatters, rags, split ears groundlings, part capable nothing inexplicable dumb shows noise. I would fellow whipped o'erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods Herod. Pray you, avoid it. Be tame neither, let discretion tutor. Suit action word, word action, special observance, o'erstep modesty nature. For anything o'erdone purpose playing, whose end, first now, hold, 'twere, mirror nature, show virtue feature, scorn image, age body time form pressure. Now overdone come tardy off, though makes unskillful laugh, cannot make judicious grieve, censure one must allowance o'erweigh whole theater others. O, players I seen play heard others praise (and highly), speak profanely, that, neither th' accent Christians gait Christian, pagan, man, strutted bellowed I thought nature's journeymen made men, made well, imitated humanity abominably. O, reform altogether. And let play clowns speak set them, laugh, set quantity barren spectators laugh too, though meantime necessary question play considered. That's villainous shows pitiful ambition fool uses it. Go make ready. Bid players make haste. Will two help hasten them? What ho, Horatio! Horatio, thou art e'en man As e'er conversation coped withal. Nay, think I flatter, For advancement may I hope thee That revenue hast thy good spirits To feed clothe thee? Why poor flattered? No, let candied tongue lick absurd pomp And crook pregnant hinges knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since dear soul mistress choice And could men distinguish, election Hath sealed thee herself. For thou hast As one suffering suffers nothing, A man Fortune's buffets rewards Hast ta'en equal thanks; blessed Whose blood judgment well commeddled That pipe Fortune's finger To sound stop please. Give man That passion's slave, I wear In heart's core, ay, heart heart, As I thee.--Something much this.-- There play tonight King. One scene comes near circumstance Which I told thee father's death. I prithee, thou seest act afoot, Even comment thy soul Observe uncle. If occulted guilt Do unkennel one speech, It damned ghost seen, And imaginations foul As Vulcan's stithy. Give heedful note, For I mine eyes rivet face, And, after, judgments join In censure seeming. They coming play. I must idle. Get place. Excellent, i' faith, chameleon's dish. I eat air, promise-crammed. You cannot feed capons so. No, mine now. My lord, played i' th' university, say? What enact? It brute part kill capital calf there.--Be players ready? No, good mother. Here's metal attractive. Lady, shall I lie lap? I mean, head upon lap? Do think I meant country matters? That's fair thought lie maids' legs. Nothing. Who, I? O God, jig-maker. What man merry? For look cheerfully mother looks, father died within 's two hours. So long? Nay, then, let devil wear black, I'll suit sables. O heavens, die two months ago, forgotten yet? Then there's hope great man's memory may outlive life half year. But, 'r Lady, must build churches, then, else shall suffer thinking on, hobby-horse, whose epitaph "For oh, oh, hobby-horse forgot." Marry, miching mallecho. It means mischief. We shall know fellow. The players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all. Ay, show show him. Be ashamed show, he'll shame tell means. Is prologue posy ring? As woman's love. That's wormwood! If break now! Madam, like play? O, she'll keep word. No, no, jest, poison jest. No offense i' th' world. "The Mousetrap." Marry, how? Tropically. This play image murder done Vienna. Gonzago duke's name, wife Baptista. You shall see anon. 'Tis knavish piece work, that? Your Majesty free souls, touches us not. Let galled jade wince; withers unwrung. I could interpret love, I could see puppets dallying. It would cost groaning take mine edge. So mis-take husbands.--Begin, murderer. Pox, leave thy damnable faces begin. Come, croaking raven doth bellow revenge. He poisons i' th' garden estate. His name's Gonzago. The story extant written choice Italian. You shall see anon murderer gets love Gonzago's wife. What, frighted false fire? Why, let strucken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play. For must watch, must sleep: Thus runs world away. Would this, sir, forest feathers (if rest fortunes turn Turk me) two Provincial roses razed shoes, get fellowship cry players? A whole one, I. For thou dost know, O Damon dear, This realm dismantled Of Jove himself, reigns A very--pajock. O good Horatio, I'll take ghost's word thousand pound. Didst perceive? Upon talk poisoning? Ah ha! Come, music! Come, recorders! For King like comedy, Why, then, belike likes not, perdy. Come, music! Sir, whole history. Ay, sir, him? With drink, sir? Your wisdom show richer signify doctor, put purgation would perhaps plunge choler. I tame, sir. Pronounce. You welcome. Sir, I cannot. Make wholesome answer. My wit's diseased. But, sir, answer I make, shall command--or, rather, say, mother. Therefore matter. My mother, say-- O wonderful son 'stonish mother! But sequel heels mother's admiration? Impart. We shall obey, ten times mother. Have trade us? And still, pickers stealers. Sir, I lack advancement. Ay, sir, "While grass grows"--the proverb something musty. I well understand that. Will play upon pipe? I pray you. I beseech you. It easy lying. Govern ventages fingers thumb, give breath mouth, discourse eloquent music. Look you, stops. Why, look now, unworthy thing make me! You would play upon me, would seem know stops, would pluck heart mystery, would sound lowest note top compass; much music, excellent voice, little organ, yet cannot make speak. 'Sblood, think I easier played pipe? Call instrument will, though fret me, cannot play upon me. Do see yonder cloud that's almost shape camel? Methinks like weasel. Or like whale. Then I come mother by. They fool top bent.--I come by. "By by" easily said. Leave me, friends. 'Tis witching time night, When churchyards yawn hell breathes Contagion world. Now could I drink hot blood And bitter business day Would quake look on. Soft, mother. O heart, lose thy nature; let ever The soul Nero enter firm bosom. Let cruel, unnatural. I speak daggers her, use none. My tongue soul hypocrites: How words somever shent, To give seals never, soul, consent. Now might I pat, a-praying, And I'll 't. And goes heaven, And I revenged. That would scanned: A villain kills father, that, I, sole son, villain send To heaven. Why, hire salary, revenge. He took father grossly, full bread, With crimes broad blown, flush May; And audit stands knows save heaven. But circumstance course thought 'Tis heavy him. And I revenged To take purging soul, When fit seasoned passage? No. Up sword, know thou horrid hent. When drunk asleep, rage, Or th' incestuous pleasure bed, At game, a-swearing, act That relish salvation 't-- Then trip him, heels may kick heaven, And soul may damned black As hell, whereto goes. My mother stays. This physic prolongs thy sickly days. HAMLET, Mother, mother, mother! Now, mother, what's matter? Mother, father much offended. Go, go, question wicked tongue. What's matter now? No, rood, so. You Queen, husband's brother's wife, And (would so) mother. Come, come, sit down; shall budge. You go till I set glass Where may see inmost part you. How now, rat? Dead ducat, dead. arras. Nay, I know not. Is King? A bloody deed--almost bad, good mother, As kill king marry brother. Ay, lady, word. Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell. I took thee thy better. Take thy fortune. Thou find'st busy danger. Leave wringing hands. Peace, sit down, And let wring heart; I shall If made penetrable stuff, If damned custom brazed That proof bulwark sense. Such act That blurs grace blush modesty, Calls virtue hypocrite, takes rose From fair forehead innocent love And sets blister there, makes marriage vows As false dicers' oaths--O, deed As body contraction plucks The soul, sweet religion makes A rhapsody words! Heaven's face glow O'er solidity compound mass With heated visage, doom, Is thought-sick act. Look upon picture this, The counterfeit presentment two brothers. See grace seated brow, Hyperion's curls, front Jove himself, An eye like Mars' threaten command, A station like herald Mercury New-lighted heaven-kissing hill, A combination form indeed Where every god seem set seal To give world assurance man. This husband. Look follows. Here husband, like mildewed ear Blasting wholesome brother. Have eyes? Could fair mountain leave feed And batten moor? Ha! Have eyes? You cannot call love, age The heyday blood tame, humble And waits upon judgment; judgment Would step this? Sense sure have, Else could motion; sure sense Is apoplexed; madness would err, Nor sense ecstasy ne'er thralled, But reserved quantity choice To serve difference. What devil 't That thus hath cozened hoodman-blind? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands eyes, smelling sans all, Or sickly part one true sense Could mope. O shame, thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine matron's bones, To flaming youth let virtue wax And melt fire. Proclaim shame When compulsive ardor gives charge, Since frost actively doth burn, And reason panders will. Nay, live In rank sweat enseamed bed, Stewed corruption, honeying making love Over nasty sty! A murderer villain, A slave twentieth part tithe Of precedent lord; vice kings, A cutpurse empire rule, That shelf precious diadem stole And put pocket-- A king shreds patches-- Do come tardy son chide, That, lapsed time passion, lets go Th' important acting dread command? O, say! How you, lady? On him, him! Look pale glares. His form cause conjoined, preaching stones, Would make capable. Do look upon me, Lest piteous action convert My stern effects. Then I Will want true color--tears perchance blood. Do see nothing there? Nor nothing hear? Why, look there, look steals away! My father, habit lived! Look goes even portal! Ecstasy? My pulse doth temperately keep time And makes healthful music. It madness That I uttered. Bring test, And I matter reword, madness Would gambol from. Mother, love grace, Lay flattering unction soul That trespass madness speaks. It skin film ulcerous place, Whiles rank corruption, mining within, Infects unseen. Confess heaven, Repent what's past, avoid come, And spread compost weeds To make ranker. Forgive virtue, For, fatness pursy times, Virtue vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb woo leave good. O, throw away worser part it, And live purer half! Good night. But go uncle's bed. Assume virtue not. That monster, custom, sense doth eat, Of habits devil, angel yet this, That use actions fair good He likewise gives frock livery That aptly put on. Refrain tonight, And shall lend kind easiness To next abstinence, next easy; For use almost change stamp nature And either ... devil throw With wondrous potency. Once more, good night, And, desirous blest, I'll blessing beg you. For lord I repent; heaven hath pleased To punish me, That I must scourge minister. I bestow answer well The death I gave him. So, again, good night. I must cruel kind. This bad begins, worse remains behind. One word more, good lady. Not means I bid do: Let bloat king tempt bed, Pinch wanton cheek, call mouse, And let him, pair reechy kisses Or paddling neck damned fingers, Make ravel matter That I essentially madness, But mad craft. 'Twere good let know, For that's queen, fair, sober, wise, Would paddock, bat, gib, Such dear concernings hide? Who would so? No, despite sense secrecy, Unpeg basket house's top, Let birds fly, like famous ape, To try conclusions, basket creep And break neck down. I must England, know that. There's letters sealed; two schoolfellows, Whom I trust I adders fanged, They bear mandate; must sweep way And marshal knavery. Let work, For 'tis sport enginer Hoist petard; 't shall go hard But I delve one yard mines And blow moon. O, 'tis sweet When one line two crafts directly meet. This man shall set packing. I'll lug guts neighbor room. Mother, good night indeed. This counselor Is still, secret, grave, Who life foolish prating knave.-- Come, sir, draw toward end you.-- Good night, mother.
