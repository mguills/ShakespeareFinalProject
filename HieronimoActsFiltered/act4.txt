 HIERONIMO: But may Bel-imperia ... Vows revenge hath deigned say? Why I see heaven applies drift, And Saints sit soliciting For vengeance cursed murderers. Madam, tis true, I find so, I found letter, written name, And Letter, Horatio died. Pardon, O pardon, Bel-imperia, My fear care believing it; Nor think I thoughtless think upon mean ... To let death unrevenged full: And I vow -- give consent, And conceal resolution -- I erelong determine deaths That causeless thus murdered son. HIERONIMO: On then; whatsoever I devise, Let entreat you, grace practices: ... For plot's already mine head. Here are. HIERONIMO: Aye, Lord; courting as, I promise you, She hath heart, you, Lord, hers. HIERONIMO: My help? Why, good Lords, assure me; For given cause; aye, faith, you. HIERONIMO: Is all? HIERONIMO: Why then, I'll fit you; say more. When I young, I gave mind ... And plied fruitless Poetry; Which though profit professor naught, Yet passing pleasing world. HIERONIMO: Marry, good Lord, thus: (And yet, methinks, quick us): -- When Toledo I studied, It chance write Tragedy, See here, Lords -- Which, long forgot, I found day. Now would Lordships favor much ... As grace acting -- I mean one play part -- Assure prove passing strange, And wondrous plausible assembly. HIERONIMO: Why, Nero thought disparagement, And Kings Emperors ta'en delight To make experience wits plays. HIERONIMO: Now, good Lord, could entreat Your sister Bel-imperia make one? For what's play without woman it? HIERONIMO: Why well: I tell you, Lordings, It determined acted ... By Gentlemen scholars too, Such could tell speak. HIERONIMO: That shall I roundly. The Chronicles Spain Record written Knight Rhodes: He betrothed, wedded length, To one Perseda, Italian Dame, ... Whose beauty ravished beheld, Especially soul Soliman, Who marriage chiefest guest. By sundry means sought Soliman win Perseda's love, could gain same. Then 'gan break passions friend, One Bashaws held full dear; Her Bashaw long solicited, And saw otherwise won, But husband's death, Knight Rhodes, ... Whom presently treachery slew. She, stirred exceeding hate therefore, As cause this, slew Soliman, And, escape Bashaw's tyranny, Did stab herself, Tragedy. HIERONIMO: Marry, thus: Moved remorse misdeeds, Ran mountain-top, hung himself. ... HIERONIMO: Oh, I, Lords, make doubt it: I'll play murderer, I warrant you; For I already conceited that. HIERONIMO: Great Soliman, Turkish Emperor. HIERONIMO: Erastus, Knight Rhodes. HIERONIMO: Perseda, chaste resolute. -- And here, Lords, several abstracts drawn, ... For note parts, And act it, occasion's offered you. You must provide Turkish cap, A black mustachio, Falchion; You, Cross, like Knight Rhodes; And Madam, must attire yourself, Like Phoebe, Flora, huntress, Which discretion shall seem best. And me, Lords, I'll look one, And ransom Viceroy sent, ... So furnish perform Tragedy, As world shall say, Hieronimo Was liberal gracing so. HIERONIMO: A Comedy? Fie, Comedies fit common wits: But present Kingly troop withal, Give stately-written Tragedy; Tragedia cothurnata, fitting Kings, Containing matter, common things. ... My Lords, must perfourmed, As fitting first night's reveling. The Italian Tragedians sharp wit That one hour's meditation They would perform anything action. HIERONIMO: In Paris? Mass, well remembered. There's one thing rests us do. HIERONIMO: Each one us must act part In unknown languages, That may breed variety: As you, Lord, Latin, I Greek, You Italian, I know That Bel-imperia hath practiced French, In courtly French shall phrases be. HIERONIMO: It must so; conclusion Shall prove intention, good: And I Oration, And strange wondrous show besides, That I behind curtain, Assure yourself, shall make matter known: And shall concluded one Scene, For there's pleasure ta'en tediousness. HIERONIMO: You'll ply gear? HIERONIMO: Why so: Now shall I see fall Babylon, Wrought heavens confusion. And world like tragedy, Hard hap old Hieronimo. HIERONIMO: Oh sir, author's credit, To look things may go well. But, good Lord, let entreat grace To give King copy play: This argument show. HIERONIMO: One thing more, good Lord. HIERONIMO: Let entreat grace ... That, train passed gallery, You would vouchsafe throw key. HIERONIMO: What, ready, Balthazar? Bring chair cushion King. Well done, Balthazar, Hang Title: Our scene Rhodes: -- what, beard on? HIERONIMO: Dispatch, shame; long? ... Bethink thyself, Hieronimo, Recall thy wits, recompt thy former wrongs Thou hast received murder thy son. And lastly, least, Isabel, Once mother thy dearest wife, All woe-begone him, hath slain herself. Behooves thee then, Hieronimo, revenged. The plot laid dire revenge: On, then, Hieronimo, pursue revenge, For nothing wants acting revenge. HIERONIMO: 'Whatever joy earth yields, betide Majesty.' HIERONIMO: 'Let Perseda grace attend.' HIERONIMO: 'Remove Erasto, mighty Soliman, And Perseda quickly won.' HIERONIMO: 'Let Erasto live grieve great Soliman.' HIERONIMO: 'But rival, let die.' HIERONIMO: 'Erasto, Soliman saluteth thee, ... And lets thee wit highness' will, Which is, thou shouldest thus employed.' HIERONIMO: But Bel-imperia plays Perseda well. HIERONIMO: Marry, follows Hieronimo: Here break sundry languages, And thus conclude I vulgar tongue. Happily think -- bootless thoughts -- That fabulously counterfeit, And Tragedians do: To die today fashioning Scene -- The death Ajax Roman peer -- ... And minute starting again, Revive please tomorrow's audience. No, Princes; know I Hieronimo, The hopeless father hapless Son, Whose tongue tuned tell latest tale, Not excuse gross errors play. I see looks urge instance words; Behold reason urging this: See show, look spectacle: Here lay hope, hope hath end: ... Here lay heart, heart slain: Here lay treasure, treasure lost: Here lay bliss, bliss bereft: But hope, heart, treasure, joy bliss, All fled, failed, died, yea, decayed this. From forth wounds came breath gave life; They murdered made fatal marks. The cause love, whence grew mortal hate; The hate: Lorenzo young Balthazar: The love: son Bel-imperia. ... But night, coverer accursed crimes, With pitchy silence hushed traitors' harms, And lent leave, sorted leisure To take advantage Garden-plot Upon Son, dear Horatio: There merciless butchered boy, In black dark night, pale dim, cruel death. He shrieks: I heard, yet, methinks, I hear His dismal out-cry echo air. With soonest speed I hasted noise, ... Where hanging tree I found son, Through-girt wounds, slaughtered see. And grieved I (think you) spectacle? Speak, Portuguese, whose loss resembles mine: If thou canst weep upon thy Balthazar, Tis like I wailed Horatio. And you, L, whose reconciled son Marched net, thought unseen, And rated brain-sick lunacy, With 'God amend mad Hieronimo,' ... How brook play's Catastrophe? And behold bloody handkercher, Which Horatio's death I weeping dipped Within river bleeding wounds. It propitious, see, I reserved, And never hath left bloody heart, Soliciting remembrance vow With these, Oh, accursed murderers: Which, performed, heart satisfied. And end Bashaw I became, That might revenge Lorenzo's life, ... Who therefore appointed part, And represent Knight Rhodes, That I might kill conveniently. So, Viceroy, thus Balthazar, thy Son, That Soliman Bel-imperia, In person Perseda, murdered: Solely appointed tragic part That might slay offended her. Poor Bel-imperia missed part this, ... For though story saith died, Yet I kindness, care her, Did otherwise determine end; But love him, hate much Did urge resolution such. And, Princes, behold Hieronimo, Author actor Tragedy, Bearing latest fortune fist; And resolute conclude part As Actors gone before. ... And, Gentles, thus I end play; Urge words, I say. HIERONIMO: Viceroy, I trust thee life, Which I day offered son. ... Accused wretch, Why stayest thou resolved die? HIERONIMO: Oh, good words: dear Horatio, As yours, yours, yours, L, you, My guiltless Son Lorenzo slain, ... And Lorenzo Balthazar Am I last revenged thoroughly, Upon whose souls may heavens yet avenged With greater far afflictions. HIERONIMO: What lesser liberty kings afford Than harmless silence? afford me. ... Sufficeth, I may not, I tell thee. HIERONIMO: Indeed thou mayest torment me, wretched Son Hath done murd'ring Horatio: But never shall thou force reveal The thing I vowed inviolate. And therefore, despite thy threats, Pleased deaths, eased revenge, First take tongue, afterwards heart. ... HIERONIMO: But sure dead? HIERONIMO: What, too? HIERONIMO: Nay, I care not; come, shall friends; Let us lay heads together: See, here's goodly noose hold all. HIERONIMO: Secure? doest thou wonder it? ... I tell thee, Viceroy, day I seen revenge, And sight grown prouder monarch Than ever sat Crown Spain. Had I many lives Stars, As many heavens go to, lives, I'd give all, aye, soul boot, But I would see thee ride red pool. HIERONIMO: Oh, good words: dear Horatio, As yours, yours, yours, L, you, My guiltless Son Lorenzo slain, ... And Lorenzo Balthazar Am I last revenged thoroughly, Upon whose souls may heavens yet avenged With greater far afflictions. HIERONIMO: Methinks, since I grew inward Revenge, ... I cannot look scorn enough Death. HIERONIMO: Do, do, do; meantime I'll torture you. You Son (as I take it), Son Should ha'e married daughter: ha, wast so? You Son too, Liege's Nephew; He proud politic. Had lived, He might come wear crown Spain -- I thinke 'twas so: 'twas I killed him; ... Look you, hand 'twas stabbed His heart -- ye see? hand -- For one Horatio, ever knew him: A youth, one hanged father's garden, One force valiant Son yield, While valiant Son take prisoner. HIERONIMO: Now I applaud I acted. ... Nunc iners cadat manus. Now express rupture part, First take tongue afterwards heart.
