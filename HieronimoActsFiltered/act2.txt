Oh poor Horatio, hadst thou misdone To leese thy life, ere life new begun? Oh wicked butcher, whatsoe'er thou wert, ... How could thou strangle virtue desert? Aye wretched, lost joy In leesing Horatio, sweet boy! HIERONIMO: Here, Isabella, help lament, For sighs stopped tears spent. HIERONIMO: To know author ease grief, ...

O aliquis mihi quas pulchrum ver educat herbas Misceat, & nostro detur medicina dolori; Aut si qui faciunt annorum oblivia, succos Prebeat; ipse metam magnum quaecungue per orbem ...

At tamen absistam properato cedere letho, Ne mortem vindicta tuam tam nulla sequatur. ...
