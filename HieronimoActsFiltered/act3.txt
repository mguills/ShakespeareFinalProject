 HIERONIMO: Oh eyes, eyes, fountains fraught tears; Oh life, life, lively form death; Oh world, world, mass public wrongs, Confused filled murder misdeeds. Oh sacred heavens, unhallowed deed, If inhuman barbarous attempt, If incomparable murder thus Of mine, son, Shall unrevealed unrevenged pass, How term dealings just, ... If unjustly deal those, justice trust? The night, sad secretary moans, With direful visions wakes vexed soul, And wounds distressful son Solicits notice death. The ugly fiends sally forth hell, And frame steps unfrequented paths, And fear heart fierce inflamed thoughts. The cloudy day discontents records, Early begins register dreams, ... And drive forth seek murtherer. Eyes, life, world, heavens, hell, night day, See, search, show, send man, mean, may -- What's here? letter? tush, so: A letter written Hieronimo. For want ink, receive bloody writ: Me hath hapless brother hid thee; Revenge thyself Balthazar him: For murdered thy son. Hieronimo, revenge Horatio's death, ... And better fare Bel-imperia doth. What means unexpected miracle? My son slain Lorenzo Prince. What cause Horatio malign? Or might move thee, Bel-imperia, To accuse thy brother, mean? Hieronimo, beware, thou art betrayed, And entrap thy life, train laid. Advise thee therefore, credulous: This devised endanger thee, ... That thou Lorenzo shouldst accuse; And he, thy dishonor done, draw Thy life question thy name hate. Dear life beloved son, And death behoves revenged: Then hazard thine own, Hieronimo, But live t'effect thy resolution. I therefore circumstances try, What I gather, confirm writ; And hearkening near Duke Castile's house, ... Close, I can, Bel-imperia, To listen nothing bewray. Now, Pedringano. HIERONIMO: Where's thy Lady? HIERONIMO: My Lord -- HIERONIMO: Nay, nay, Lord, I thank you, shall need; I suit unto her, late, And disgrace makes unfortunate. HIERONIMO: Oh no, Lord; I dare not; must be: I humbly thank Lordship. HIERONIMO: Who? you, Lord? I reserve favor greater honor; This toy, Lord, toy. HIERONIMO: Y' faith, Lord, tis idle thing I must confess, I ha' slack, tardy, remiss unto honor. HIERONIMO: In troth, Lord, thing nothing: The murder Son, -- A thing nothing, Lord. HIERONIMO: My grief heart, thoughts tongue tell. HIERONIMO: Thus must toil men's extremes, That know remedy own; And justice, unjustly we, For wrongs, compass redress. But shall I never live see day, That I may come (by justice heavens) To know cause may cares allay? This toils body, consumeth age, That I men must be, And neither gods men me. ... HIERONIMO: So is't duty regard death, Who, lived, deserved dearest blood. But come came for: let's begin; For lies bids gone. HIERONIMO: Stand forth, thou monster, murderer men; And here, satisfaction world, Confess thy folly repent thy fault; For there's thy place execution. HIERONIMO: Peace, impudent, thou shalt find so; For blood blood shall, I sit judge, Be satisfied, law discharged. And though cannot receive like, Yet I see others right. Dispatch: fault's approved confessed, And law condemned die. ... HIERONIMO: I seen wretch impudent. Oh monstrous times, murder's set light, ... And soul, shrined heaven, Solely delights interdicted things, Still wand'ring thorny passages, That intercepts happiness. Murder, oh bloody monster! God forbid A fault foul 'scape unpunished. Dispatch, see execution done. This makes remember thee, son. HIERONIMO: Where shall I run breathe abroad woes, My woes, whose weight hath wearied earth? Or mine exclaims, surcharged air With ceaseless plaints deceased son? The blust'ring winds, conspiring words, At lament moved leafless trees, Disrobed meadows flowered green, Made mountains marsh spring-tides tears And broken brazen gates hell. Yet still tormented tortured soul ... With broken sighs restless passions That winged mount; and, hovering air, Beat windows brightest heavens, Soliciting justice revenge: But placed imperial heights, Where, countermured walls diamond, I find place impregnable; Resist woes give words way. HIERONIMO: Well, him? HIERONIMO: I warrant thee, give me. HIERONIMO: Aye, aye. HIERONIMO: And yet, though somewhat nearer concerns, I will, ease grief I sustain, ... Take truce sorrow I read this. 'My Lord, I write mine extremes required, That would labor delivery; If neglect, life desperate, And death I shall reveal troth. You know, Lord, I slew sake, And confederate Prince you; Won rewards hopeful promises, I help murder Don Horatio too.' Help murder mine Horatio? ... And actors th' accursed Tragedy Wast thou, Lorenzo, Balthazar thou, Of son, son deserved well? What I heard, mine eyes beheld? Oh sacred heavens, may come pass That monstrous detested deed, So closely smothered, long concealed, Shall thus venged revealed? Now see I I durst suspect, That Bel-imperia's Letter feigned. ... Nor feigned she, though falsely wronged Both her, myself, Horatio, themselves. Now may I make compare 'twixt this, Of every accident I ne'er could find Til now, I feelingly perceive They heaven unpunished would leave. Oh false Lorenzo: thy flattering looks? Is honor thou didst son? And Balthazar, bane soul me: Was ransom reserved thee for? ... Woe cause constrained wars; Woe thy baseness captivity; Woe thy birth, thy body, thy soul, Thy cursed father, thy conquered self; And banned bitter execrations The day place pity thee. But wherefore waste I mine unfruitful words, When naught blood satisfy woes? I go plain Lord King, And cry aloud justice Court, ... Wearing flints withered feet; And either purchase justice entreats, Or tire revenging threats. HIERONIMO: Tis neither think, think, Nor think; wide all: These slippers mine, son Horatio's. My son -- what's son? A thing begot Within pair minutes, thereabout: A lump bred darkness, doth serve To ballace light creatures call women; And nine months' end, creeps forth light. What yet son, To make father dote, rave, run mad? ... Being born, pouts, cries, breeds teeth. What yet son? He must fed, Be taught go, speak. Aye, yet? Why might man love calf well? Or melt passion o'er frisking kid, As son? Methinks, young bacon, Or fine little smooth horse-colt, Should move man much doth son. For one these, little time, Will grow good use; whereas son, ... The grows stature years, The unsquared, unbeveled, appears, Reckons parents among rank fools, Strikes care upon heads mad riots, Makes look old meet age. This son -- And loss this, considered truly? -- Oh, Horatio Grew reach insatiate humors: He loved loving parents; ... He comfort, mother's joy, The arm hold house: Our hopes stored him, None damned murderer could hate him. He seen back nineteen year, When strong arm unhorsed proud Prince Balthazar, And great mind, full Honor, Took unto mercy: That valiant, ignoble Portingale. Well, heaven heaven still. ... And Nemesis, Furies, And things called whips, And sometimes meet murderers: They always 'scape, comfort, Aye, aye, aye; time steals on, And steals, steals, Til violence leaps forth like thunder Wrapped ball fire, And doth bring confusion all. HIERONIMO: The next way me. HIERONIMO: Oh, hard by: tis yon house see. HIERONIMO: Who, Lord Lorenzo? HIERONIMO: Oh, forbear, For talk us far fitter were. But importunate know ... The way find out, Then list me, I'll resolve doubt. There path upon left-hand side That leadeth guilty conscience Unto forest distrust fear, A darksome place, dangerous pass: There shall meet melancholy thoughts, Whose baleful humors uphold, It conduct despair death: Whose rocky cliffs beheld, ... Within hugy dale lasting night, That, kindled world's iniquities, Doth cast filthy detested fumes: -- Not far thence, murderers built A habitation cursed souls, There, brazen cauldron, fixed Jove, In fell wrath, upon sulfur flame, Yourselves shall find Lorenzo bathing In boiling lead blood innocents. HIERONIMO: Ha, ha, ha! ... Why, ha, ha, ha! Farewell, good ha, ha, ha. HIERONIMO: Now, sir, perhaps I come see King; The King sees me, fain would hear suit; Why, strange seld-seen thing, That standers-by toys strike mute? Go to, I see shifts say more. Hieronimo, tis time thee trudge: Down dale flows purple gore, Standeth fiery Tower; sits judge Upon seat steel molten brass, And 'twixt teeth holds fire-brand ... That leads unto lake hell doth stand. Away, Hieronimo! To gone: He'll thee justice Horatio's death. Turn path: thou shalt straight; Or this, thou needst take thy breath: This way, way -- soft fair, so: For I hang kill myself, let's know Who revenge Horatio's murder then? No, no; fie, no: pardon me, I'll none that. This way I'll take, way comes King, ... And I'll fling him, that's flat. And Balthazar, I'll thee bring, And thee, Lorenzo. Here's King -- nay, stay, And here, aye -- goes hare away. HIERONIMO: Justice, oh, justice Hieronimo. HIERONIMO: Oh, so? HIERONIMO: Not I. Hieronimo beware; goe by, goe by. HIERONIMO: Horatio, calls Horatio? ... HIERONIMO: Justice, Oh, justice, justice, gentle King. HIERONIMO: Justice! Oh justice: Oh son, son, My son, naught ransom redeem. HIERONIMO: Away, Lorenzo, hinder more. For thou hast made bankrupt bliss. Give son; shall ransom him. ... Away, I'll rip bowels earth, And ferry th' Elysian plains, And bring son show deadly wounds. Stand me; I'll make pickaxe poniard, And surrender marshalship; For I'll go marshal fiends hell, To avenged this. HIERONIMO: Nay, soft fair; shall need strive; Needs must go devils drive. HIERONIMO: I pry every crevice wall, Look tree search every brake, Beat bushes, stamp grandam earth, Dive water stare heaven: ... Yet cannot I behold son Horatio. -- How now, who's there? Spirits, spirits? HIERONIMO: What make torches dark? HIERONIMO: No, no, deceived -- I -- deceived. Was I mad bid light torches now? Light torches mid noon, Whenas sun-god rides glory: Light torches then. HIERONIMO: Let burnt; night murderous slut That would treasons seen; And yonder pale-faced Hecate there, Moon, Doth give consent done darkness; And Stars gaze upon face Are aeglets sleeve, pins train; And powerful divine Do sleep darkness, shine. HIERONIMO: Villain, thou liest, thou dost nought But tell I mad: Thou liest, I mad! I know thee Pedro, Jaques. I'll prove thee; I mad, could I? Where night Horatio Was murdered? She shone: Search thou book. Had moon shone boy's face kind grace, That I know -- nay, I know -- murderer seen him, His weapon would fall'n cut earth, ... Had framed naught blood death. Alack, mischief doth knows what, What shall say mischief? HIERONIMO: Indeed, Isabella, nothing here; I cry: ask Pedro, ask Jaques; Not I, indeed; merry, merry. ISABELLA: How? Be merry here, merry here? Is place, tree, ... Where Horatio died, murdered? HIERONIMO: Was -- say what: let weep out. This tree; I set kernel: And hot Spain could let grow, But infant human sap Began wither, duly twice morning Would I sprinkling fountain-water. At last grew, grew, bore, bore, Til length It grew gallows, bear sonne, ... It bore thy fruit mine: oh wicked, wicked plant. See knocks there. HIERONIMO: Bid come in, paint comfort, For surely there's none lives painted comfort. Let come in. One knows may chance: Gods I set tree -- even Masters' ungrateful servants rear nought, And hate bring up. HIERONIMO: Wherefore, why, thou scornful villain? How, where, means I blest? ... HIERONIMO: Oh ambitious beggar, wouldst thou That lives world? Why, undelved mines cannot buy An ounce justice; tis jewel inestimable. I tell thee, God hath engrossed justice hands, And none comes him. HIERONIMO: How, thy son murdered? HIERONIMO: What, thine? That's lie As massy earth: I son Whose least unvalued hair weigh A thousand thy son's: murdered. HIERONIMO: Nor I, I: one mine Was worth legion. But one. Pedro, Jaques, go a-doors; Isabella, go, And good fellow I Will range hideous orchard down, ... Like two Lions reaved young. Go a-doors, I say. Come, let's talk wisely now. Was thy son murdered? HIERONIMO: So mine. How dost take it? Art thou sometimes mad? Is tricks comes thine eyes? HIERONIMO: Art Painter? canst paint tear, wound, groan sigh? Canst paint tree this? HIERONIMO: Bazardo, afore-god, excellent fellow. Look you, sir, see, I'd paint Gallery, oil colors matted, draw five years younger I -- ye see, sir, let five years go, let go like Marshal Spain -- wife Isabella standing me, speaking look son Horatio, intend such-like purpose: 'God bless thee, sweet son,' hand leaning upon head, thus, sir. Do see? may done? HIERONIMO: Nay, I pray, mark me, sir: then, sir, would I paint tree, tree. Canst paint doleful cry? HIERONIMO: Nay, cry; one. Well, sir, paint youth run villain's swords, hanging upon tree. Canst thou draw murderer? HIERONIMO: Oh, let worse, worse: stretch thine Art, let beards Judas color; let ... eyebrows jutty over: case observe that. Then, sir, violent noise, bring forth shirt, gown mine arm, torch hand sword reared thus: words: 'What noise this? Who calls Hieronimo?' May done? HIERONIMO: Well, sir; bring forth, bring alley alley, still distracted countenance going along, let hair heave night-cap. Let Clouds scowl, make Moon dark, Stars extinct, Winds blowing, Bells tolling, Owl shrieking, Toads croaking, minutes ... jarring, clock striking twelve. And last, sir, starting, behold man hanging, tottering, tottering, know wind wave man, I trice cut down. And looking upon advantage torch, find son Horatio. There may passion, may show passion. Draw like old Priam Troy, crying: 'the house a-fire, house a-fire, torch head!' Make curse, make rave, make cry, make mad, make well again, make curse hell, invocate heaven, end leave trance -- forth. HIERONIMO: Oh no, end: end death madness. As I never better I mad; methinks I brave fellow; I wonders: reason abuseth me, there's torment, there's hell. At last, sir, bring one murderers; strong Hector, thus would I tear drag drown. HIERONIMO: Vindicta mihi! Aye, heaven revenged every ill; Nor suffer murder unrepaid. Then stay, Hieronimo, attend will: For mortal men may appoint time. Per scelus semper tutum est sceleribus iter. Strike, strike home, wrong offered thee; For evils unto ills conductors be, And death's worst resolution. For thinks patience contend ... To quiet life, life shall easily end. -- Fata si miseros juvant, habes salutem; Fata si vitam negant, habes sepulchrum: If destiny thy miseries ease, Then hast thou health, happy shalt thou be: If destiny deny thee life, Hieronimo, Yet shalt thou assured tomb: If neither, yet let thy comfort be, Heaven covereth hath burial. And conclude, I revenge death, ... But how? vulgar wits men, With open, inevitable ills, As secret, yet certain mean, Which kind-ship cloaked best. Wise men take opportunity, Closely safely fitting things time. But extremes advantage hath time. And therefore times fit revenge Thus therefore I rest unrest, Dissembling quiet unquietness, ... Not seeming I know villainies, That simplicity may make think That ignorantly I let slip: For ignorance, I wot, well know, Remedium malorum iners est. Nor ought avails menace Who, wintry storm upon plain, Will bear nobility. No, no, Hieronimo, thou must enjoin Thine eyes observation, thy tongue ... To milder speeches thy spirit affords; Thy heart patience thy hands rest, Thy Cap courtesy, thy knee bow, Til revenge thou know when, where, how. How now, noise? What coil keep? HIERONIMO: That I plead several actions? Why, let enter, let see them. ... HIERONIMO: Come near, men, thus importune me. -- Now must I bear face gravity, For thus I used, Marshalship, To plead causes Corregidor. -- Come on, sirs, what's matter? HIERONIMO: Of Battery? HIERONIMO: Give place. ... HIERONIMO: Content you, sirs; determined That I plead several actions? HIERONIMO: But wherefore stands yon silly man mute, With mournful eyes hands heaven upreared? Come hither, father, let know thy cause. HIERONIMO: Say, father, tell what's thy suit? HIERONIMO: What's here? 'The humble supplication Of Don Bazulto murdered son.' HIERONIMO: No, sir, murdered son, ... Oh son, son, Oh son Horatio. But mine, thine, Bazulto, content. Here, take handercher, wipe thine eyes, Whiles wretched I thy mishaps may see The lively portrait dying self. Oh no, this; Horatio, thine; And I dyed thy dearest blood, This token twixt thy soul me, That thy death revenged I be. But here, take this, -- what, purse? -- ... Aye this, that, thine; For one extremities. HIERONIMO: See, see, oh see thy shame, Hieronimo; See loving father son: Behold sorrows sad laments That delivereth son's decease. If love's effects strives lesser things, If love enforce moods meaner wits, ... If love express power poor estates; Hieronimo, when, raging Sea, Tossed wind tide, o'erturnest The upper billows' course waves keep, Whilest lesser waters labor deep: Then shamest thou not, Hieronimo, neglect The sweet revenge thy Horatio? Though earth justice found, I'll hell, passion Knock dismal gates Pluto's court, ... Getting force, Alcides did, A troop furies tormenting hags, To torture Don Lorenzo rest. Yet lest triple-headed porter Deny passage slimy strand, The Thracian poet thou shalt counterfeit. Come on, old father, Orpheus, And thou canst notes upon Harp, Then sound burden thy sore heart's grief, Til gain Proserpine may grant Revenge murdered son. ... Then I rent tear them, thus, thus, Shivering limbs pieces teeth. HIERONIMO: That cannot be, I gave never wound; Show one drop blood fall same: How possible I slay then? ... Tush, no; run after, catch can. enters again, who, staring face, speaks. HIERONIMO: And art thou come, Horatio, depth, To ask justice upper earth, To tell thy father thou art unrevenged, To wring tears Isabella's eyes, Whose lights dimmed over-long laments? Go back, son, complain Aecus; For here's justice; gentle boy, gone, For justice exiled earth: Hieronimo bear thee company. ... Thy mother cries righteous Rhadamanth For revenge murderers. HIERONIMO: But let look Horatio. Sweet boy, art thou changed death's black shade. Had Proserpine pity thy youth, But suffered thy fair crimson-colored spring With withered winter blasted thus? Horatio, thou art older thy father: Ah, ruthless fate, favor thus transforms. ... HIERONIMO: What, son? thou fury art, Sent empty Kingdom black night, To summon make appearance Before grim Minos Rhadamanth, To plague Hieronimo, remiss, And seeks vengeance Horatio's death. HIERONIMO: Aye, I know thee, thou namest thy son; ... Thou art lively image grief; Within thy face, sorrows I may see. Thy eyes gummed tears, thy cheeks wan, Thy forehead troubled, thy mutt'ring lips Murmur sad words abruptly broken By force windy sighs thy spirit breathes; And sorrow riseth thy son; And self-same sorrow feel I son. Come in, old man, thou shalt Isabel; Lean arm; I thee, thou me, shalt stay, ... And thou, I sing song, Three parts one, discords framed: -- Talk cords, let us gone, For cord Horatio slain. HIERONIMO: And where's Duke? HIERONIMO: Even so. -- What new device devised, trow? Pocas Palabras, mild Lamb: Is't I revenged? no, I man. HIERONIMO: My Lords, I thank Horatio. HIERONIMO: What, short? Then I'll gone, I thank for't. HIERONIMO: With me, sir? Lord, I thought done. HIERONIMO: Why, miserable thing, Lord? HIERONIMO: Your son Lorenzo? whom, noble Lord? The hope Spain, mine honorable friend? ... Grant combat dare: I'll meet face-to-face, tell so. These scandalous reports As love me, hate Lord much. Should I suspect Lorenzo would prevent Or cross suit, loved son well? My Lord, I ashamed said. HIERONIMO: My good Lord, I know not. HIERONIMO: Aye, marry, Lord, shall. Friends, quoth he? see, I'll friends all: Specially you, lovely Lord; For divers causes fit us That friends: world suspicious, ... And men may think imagine not. HIERONIMO: What else? shame so. HIERONIMO: Your Lordship's command. Pah: keep way: Chi mi fa piu carezze che non suole, Tradito mi ha, tradir mi voule.
