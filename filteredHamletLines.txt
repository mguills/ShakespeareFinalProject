 ---------------------------Hamlet----------------------------------- A little kin, less kind. Not so, lord; I much sun. Ay, madam, common. Seems, madam! nay, is; I know “seems.” 'Tis alone inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits solemn black, Nor windy suspiration forced breath, No, fruitful river eye, Nor dejected “haviour visage, Together forms, moods, shapes grief, That denote truly: indeed seem, For actions man might play: But I within passes show; These trappings suits woe. I shall best obey you, madam. O, sallied flesh would melt, Thaw resolve dew! Or Everlasting fixed His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! How weary, stale, flat unprofitable, Seem uses world! Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis unweeded garden, That grows seed; things rank gross nature Possess merely. That come this! But two months dead: nay, much, two: So excellent king; was, this, Hyperion satyr; loving mother That might beteem winds heaven Visit face roughly. Heaven earth! Must I remember? why, hang him, As increase appetite grown By fed on: yet, within month Let think on't — Frailty, thy name woman! A little month, ere shoes old With followed poor father's body, Like Niobe, tears: she, even O God! beast, wants discourse reason, Would mourned longer — married uncle, My father's brother, like father Than I Hercules: within month: Ere yet salt unrighteous tears Had left flushing galled eyes, She married. O, wicked speed, post With dexterity incestuous sheets! It cannot come good: But break, heart; I must hold tongue. I glad see well: Horatio, I forget myself. Sir, good friend; I'll change name you: And make Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus? I glad see you. Good even, sir. But what, faith, make Wittenberg? I would hear enemy say so, Nor shall mine ear violence, To make truster report Against yourself: I know truant. But affair Elsinore? We'll teach drink deep ere depart. I prithee, mock me, fellow student; I think see mother's wedding. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth marriage tables. Would I met dearest foe heaven Or ever I seen day, Horatio! My father! methinks I see father. In mind's eye, Horatio. He man, take all, I shall look upon like again. Saw? who? The king father? For God's love, let hear. But this? Did speak it? 'Tis strange. Indeed, indeed, sirs, troubles me. Hold watch to-night? Armed, say you? From top toe? Then saw face? What, looked frowningly? Pale red? And fixed eyes upon you? I would I there. Very like, like. Stayed long? His beard grizzled, no? I watch to-night; Perchance 'twill walk again. If assume noble father's person, I'll speak it, though hell gape And bid hold peace. I pray all, If hitherto concealed sight, Let tenable silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap to-night, Give understanding, tongue: I requite loves. So, fare well: Upon platform, 'twixt eleven twelve, I'll visit you. Your loves, mine you: farewell. My father's spirit arms! well; I doubt foul play: would night come! Till sit still, soul: foul deeds rise, Though earth o'erwhelm them, men's eyes. The air bites shrewdly; cold. What hour now? The king doth wake to-night takes rouse, Keeps wassail, swaggering up-spring reels; And, drains draughts Rhenish down, The kettle-drum trumpet thus bray The triumph pledge. Ay, marry, is't: But mind, though I native And manner born, custom More honoured breach observance. This heavy-headed revel east west Makes us traduced taxed nations: They clepe us drunkards, swinish phrase Soil addition; indeed takes From achievements, though performed height, The pith marrow attribute. So, oft chances particular men, That vicious mole nature them, As, birth — wherein guilty, Since nature cannot choose origin By o'ergrowth complexion, Oft breaking pales forts reason, Or habit much o'erleavens The form plausive manners, men, Carrying, I say, stamp one defect, Being nature's livery, fortune's star, virtues else pure grace, As infinite man may undergo Shall general censure take corruption From particular fault: dram evil Doth noble substance doubt To scandal. Angels ministers grace defend us! Be thou spirit health goblin damned, Bring thee airs heaven blasts hell, Be thy intents wicked charitable, Thou comest questionable shape That I speak thee: I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me! Let burst ignorance; tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed death, Have burst cerements; sepulchre, Wherein saw thee quietly inurned, Hath oped ponderous marble jaws, To cast thee again. What may mean, That thou, dead corse, complete steel Revisits thus glimpses moon, Making night hideous; fools nature So horridly shake disposition With thoughts beyond reaches souls? Say, this? wherefore? do? It speak; I follow it. Why, fear? I set life pin's fee; And soul, that, Being thing immortal itself? It waves forth again: I'll follow it. It waves still. Go on; I'll follow thee. Hold hands. My fate cries out, And makes petty artery body As hardy Nemean lion's nerve. Still I called. Unhand me, gentlemen. By heaven, I'll make ghost lets me! I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee. Whither wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go further. I will. Alas, poor ghost! Speak; I bound hear. What? O God! Murder! Haste know't, I, wings swift As meditation thoughts love, May sweep revenge. O prophetic soul! My uncle! O host heaven! O earth! else? And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, heart; And you, sinews, grow instant old, But bear stiffly up. Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost, memory holds seat In distracted globe. Remember thee! Yea, table memory I'll wipe away trivial fond records, All saws books, forms, pressures past, That youth observation copied there; And thy commandment alone shall live Within book volume brain, Unmixed baser matter: yes, heaven! O pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables, — meet I set down, That one may smile, smile, villain; At least I sure may Denmark: So, uncle, are. Now word; It “Adieu, adieu! remember me.” I sworn't. So it! Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come. O, wonderful! No; reveal it. How say you, then; would heart man think it? But secret? There's ne'er villain dwelling Denmark But he's arrant knave. Why, right; right; And so, without circumstance all, I hold fit shake hands part: You, business desire shall point you; For every man hath business desire, Such is; poor part, I go pray. I sorry offend you, heartily; Yes, 'faith, heartily. Yes, Saint Patrick, is, Horatio, And much offence too. Touching vision here, It honest ghost, let tell you: For desire know us, o'ermaster't may. And now, good friends, As friends, scholars soldiers, Give one poor request. Never make known seen to-night. Nay, swear't. Upon sword. Indeed, upon sword, indeed. Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny? Come — hear fellow cellarage Consent swear. Never speak seen, Swear sword. Hic et ubique? we'll shift ground. Come hither, gentlemen, And lay hands upon sword: Swear sword Never speak heard, Well said, old mole! canst work i' earth fast? A worthy pioner! Once remove, good friends. And therefore stranger give welcome. There things heaven earth, Horatio, Than dreamt philosophy. But come; Here, before, never, help mercy, How strange odd soe'er I bear myself, As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put antic disposition on, That you, times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumbered thus, headshake, Or pronouncing doubtful phrase, As “Well, well, know,” “We could, would,” Or “If list speak,” “There be, might,” Or ambiguous giving out, note That know aught me: swear, So grace mercy need help you. Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen, With love I commend you: And poor man Hamlet May do, express love friending you, God willing, shall lack. Let us go together; And still fingers lips, I pray. The time joint: O cursed spite, That ever I born set right! Nay, come, let's go together. “As lot, God wot,” “It came pass, like was,” Ay, so, God buy you; Now I alone. O, rogue peasant slave I! Is monstrous player here, But fiction, dream passion, Could force soul conceit That working visage wanned, Tears eyes, distraction aspect, A broken voice, whole function suiting With forms conceit? nothing! For Hecuba! What's Hecuba him, Hecuba, That weep her? What would do, Had motive cue passion That I have? He would drown stage tears And cleave general ear horrid speech, Make mad guilty appall free, Confound ignorant, amaze indeed The faculties eyes ears. Yet I, A dull muddy-mettled rascal, peak, Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant cause, And say nothing; no, king, Upon whose property dear life A damned defeat made. Am I coward? Who calls villain? breaks pate across? Plucks beard, blows face? Tweaks nose? gives lie i' throat, As deep lungs? this? Ha! 'Swounds, I take it: cannot But I pigeon-livered lack gall To make oppression bitter, ere I ha' fatted region kites With slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! Why, ass I! This brave, That I, son dear father murdered, Prompted revenge heaven hell, Must, like whore, unpack heart words, And fall a-cursing, like drab, A stallion! Fie upon't! foh! About, brains! Hum — I heard That guilty creatures sitting play Have cunning scene Been struck soul presently They proclaimed malefactions; For murder, though tongue, speak With miraculous organ. I'll players Play something like murder father Before mine uncle: I'll observe looks; I'll tent quick: 'a blench, I know course. The spirit I seen May devil: devil hath power To assume pleasing shape; yea, perhaps Out weakness melancholy, As potent spirits, Abuses damn me: I'll grounds More relative this: play's thing Wherein I'll catch conscience king. To be, be: question: Whether 'tis nobler mind suffer The slings arrows outrageous fortune, Or take arms sea troubles, And opposing end them? To die: sleep; No more; sleep say end The heart-ache thousand natural shocks That flesh heir to, 'tis consummation Devoutly wished. To die, sleep; To sleep: perchance dream: ay, there's rub; For sleep death dreams may come When shuffled mortal coil, Must give us pause: there's respect That makes calamity long life; For would bear whips scorns time, The oppressor's wrong, proud man's contumely, The pangs despised love, law's delay, The insolence office spurns That patient merit unworthy takes, When might quietus make With bare bodkin? would fardels bear, To grunt sweat weary life, But dread something death, The undiscovered country whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles And makes us rather bear ills Than fly others know of? Thus conscience make cowards us all; And thus native hue resolution Is sicklied o'er pale cast thought, And enterprises great pitch moment With regard currents turn awry, And lose name action. — Soft now! The fair Ophelia! Nymph, thy orisons Be sins remembered. I humbly thank you; well, well, well. No, I; I never gave aught. Horatio, thou art e'en man As e'er conversation coped withal. Nay, think I flatter; For advancement may I hope thee That revenue hast thy good spirits, To feed clothe thee? Why poor flattered? No, let candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook pregnant hinges knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since dear soul mistress choice And could men distinguish election, Sh' hath sealed thee herself; thou hast As one, suffering all, suffers nothing, A man fortune's buffets rewards Hast ta'en equal thanks: blest Whose blood judgement well commeddled, That pipe fortune's finger To sound stop please. Give man That passion's slave, I wear In heart's core, ay, heart heart, As I thee. — Something much this. There play to-night king; One scene comes near circumstance Which I told thee father's death: I prithee, thou seest act afoot, Even comment thy soul Observe uncle: occulted guilt Do unkennel one speech, It damned ghost seen, And imaginations foul As Vulcan's stithy. Give heedful note; For I mine eyes rivet face, And judgements join In censure seeming. They coming play; I must idle: Get place. If break now! 'Tis witching time night, When churchyards yawn hell breathes Contagion world: could I drink hot blood, And bitter business day Would quake look on. Soft! mother. O heart, lose thy nature; let ever The soul Nero enter firm bosom: Let cruel, unnatural: I speak daggers her, use none; My tongue soul hypocrites; How words soever shent, To give seals never, soul, consent! Now might I pat, 'a a-praying; And I'll do't. And 'a goes heaven; And I revenged. That would scanned: A villain kills father; that, I, sole son, villain send To heaven. Why, hire salary, revenge. 'A took father grossly, full bread; With crimes broad blown, flush May; And audit stands knows save heaven? But circumstance course thought. 'Tis heavy him: I revenged, To take purging soul, When fit seasoned passage? No! Up, sword; know thou horrid hent: When drunk asleep, rage, Or incestuous pleasure bed; At game, a-swearing, act That relish salvation in't; Then trip him, heels may kick heaven, And soul may damned black As hell, whereto goes. My mother stays: This physic prolongs thy sickly days. Now, mother, what's matter? Mother, father much offended. Go, go, question wicked tongue. What's matter now? No, rood, so: You queen, husband's brother's wife; And — would so! — mother. Come, come, sit down; shall budge; You go till I set glass Where may see inmost part you. How now! rat? Dead, ducat, dead! Nay, I know not: Is king? A bloody deed! almost bad, good mother, As kill king, marry brother. Ay, lady, word. Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! I took thee thy better: take thy fortune; Thou find'st busy danger. Leave wringing hands: peace! sit down, And let wring heart; I shall, If made penetrable stuff, If damned custom brassed That proof bulwark sense. Such act That blurs grace blush modesty, Calls virtue hypocrite, takes rose From fair forehead innocent love And sets blister there, makes marriage vows As false dicers' oaths: O, deed As body contraction plucks The soul, sweet religion makes A rhapsody words: heaven's face glow o'er solidity compound mass, With heated visage, doom, Is thought-sick act. Look here, upon picture, this, The counterfeit presentment two brothers. See, grace seated brow; Hyperion's curls; front Jove himself; An eye like Mars, threaten command; A station like herald Mercury New lighted heaven-kissing hill; A combination form indeed, Where every god seem set seal, To give world assurance man: This husband. Look now, follows: Here husband; like mildewed ear, Blasting wholesome brother. Have eyes? Could fair mountain leave feed, And batten moor? Ha! eyes? You cannot call love; age The hey-day blood tame, humble, And waits upon judgement: judgement Would step this? Sense, sure, have, Else could motion; sure, sense Is apoplexed; madness would err, Nor sense ecstasy ne'er thralled But reserved quantity choice, To serve difference. What devil was't That thus hath cozened hoodman-blind? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands eyes, smelling sans all, Or sickly part one true sense Could mope. O shame! thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine matron's bones, To flaming youth let virtue wax, And melt fire: proclaim shame When compulsive ardour gives charge, Since frost actively doth burn And reason panders will. Nay, live In rank sweat enseamed bed, Stewed corruption, honeying making love Over nasty sty, A murderer villain; A slave twentieth part tithe Of precedent lord; vice kings; A cutpurse empire rule, That shelf precious diadem stole, And put pocket! A king shreds patches, Save me, hover o'er wings, You heavenly guards! What would gracious figure? Do come tardy son chide, That, lapsed time passion, lets go The important acting dread command? O, say! How you, lady? On him, him! Look you, pale glares! His form cause conjoined, preaching stones, Would make capable. Do look upon me; Lest piteous action convert My stern effects: I Will want true colour; tears perchance blood. Do see nothing there? Nor nothing hear? Why, look look, steals away! My father, habit lived! Look, goes, even now, portal! Ecstasy! My pulse, yours, doth temperately keep time, And makes healthful music: madness That I uttered: bring test, And I matter re-word; madness Would gambol from. Mother, love grace, Lay flattering unction soul, That trespass, madness speaks: It skin film ulcerous place, Whiles rank corruption, mining within, Infects unseen. Confess heaven; Repent what's past; avoid come; And spread compost weeds, To make ranker. Forgive virtue; For fatness pursy times Virtue vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb woo leave good. O, throw away worser part it, And live purer half. Good night: go uncle's bed; Assume virtue, not. That monster, custom, sense doth eat, Of habits devil, angel yet this, That use actions fair good He likewise gives frock livery, That aptly put on. Refrain to-night, And shall lend kind easiness To next abstinence: next easy; For use almost change stamp nature, And either …the devil, throw With wondrous potency. Once more, good night: And desirous blessed, I'll blessing beg you. For lord, I repent: heaven hath pleased so, To punish me, That I must scourge minister. I bestow him, answer well The death I gave him. So, again, good night. I must cruel, kind: This bad begins worse remains behind. One word more, good lady. Not this, means, I bid do: Let bloat king tempt bed; Pinch wanton cheek; call mouse; And let him, pair reechy kisses, Or paddling neck damned fingers, Make ravel matter out, That I essentially madness, But mad craft. 'Twere good let know; For who, that's queen, fair, sober, wise, Would paddock, bat, gib, Such dear concernings hide? would so? No, despite sense secrecy, Unpeg basket house's top, Let birds fly, and, like famous ape, To try conclusions, basket creep, And break neck down. I must England; know that? There's letters sealed: two schoolfellows, Whom I trust I adders fanged, They bear mandate; must sweep way, And marshal knavery. Let work; For 'tis sport enginer Hoist petar: and't shall go hard But I delve one yard mines, And blow moon: O, 'tis sweet, When one line two crafts directly meet. This man shall set packing: I'll lug guts neighbour room. Mother, good night. Indeed counsellor Come, sir, draw toward end you. Good night, mother. Compounded dust, whereto 'tis kin. For England! Good. Good sir, whose powers these? How purposed, sir, I pray you? Who commands them, sir? Goes main Poland, sir, Or frontier? Why, Polack never defend it. Two thousand souls twenty thousand ducats Will debate question straw: This imposthume much wealth peace, That inward breaks, shows cause without Why man dies. I humbly thank you, sir. I'll straight. Go little before. How occasions inform me, And spur dull revenge! What man, If chief good market time Be sleep feed? beast, more. Sure, made us large discourse, Looking after, gave us That capability godlike reason To fust us unused. Now, whether Bestial oblivion, craven scruple Of thinking precisely event, A thought which, quartered, hath one part wisdom And ever three parts coward, I know Why yet I live say “This thing's do;” Sith I cause strength means To do't. Examples gross earth exhort me: Witness army mass charge Led delicate tender prince, Whose spirit divine ambition puffed Makes mouths invisible event, Exposing mortal unsure To fortune, death danger dare, Even egg-shell. Rightly great Is stir without great argument, But greatly find quarrel straw When honour's stake. How stand I then, That father killed, mother stained, Excitements reason blood, And let sleep? while, shame, I see The imminent death twenty thousand men, That, fantasy trick fame, Go graves like beds, fight plot Whereon numbers cannot try cause, Which tomb enough continent To hide slain? O, time forth, My thoughts bloody, nothing worth! But soft! soft awhile: comes king, The queen, courtiers: follow? And maimed rites? This doth betoken The corse follow desperate hand Fordo life: 'twas estate. Couch awhile mark. That Laertes, noble youth, mark. What, fair Ophelia! What whose grief Bears emphasis? whose phrase sorrow Conjures wandering stars, makes stand Like wonder-wounded hearers? This I, Hamlet Dane. Thou pray'st well. I prithee, take thy fingers throat; For, though I splenitive rash, Yet I something dangerous, Which let thy wisdom fear: hold thy hand. Why, I fight upon theme Until eyelids longer wag. I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, quantity love, Make sum. What wilt thou her? 'Swounds, show thou'lt do: Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself? Woo't drink eisel? eat crocodile? I'll do't. Dost thou come whine? To outface leaping grave? Be buried quick her, I: And, thou prate mountains, let throw Millions acres us, till ground, Singeing pate burning zone, Make Ossa like wart! Nay, thou'lt mouth, I'll rant well thou. Hear you, sir; What reason use thus? I loved ever: matter; Let Hercules may, The cat mew dog day. So much this, sir: shall see other; You remember circumstance? Sir, heart kind fighting, That would let sleep: methought I lay Worse mutines bilboes. Rashly, And praised rashness it, let us know, Our indiscretion sometime serves us well, When deep plots pall: learn us There's divinity shapes ends, Rough-hew will, Up cabin, My sea-gown scarfed me, dark Groped I find them; desire, Fingered packet, fine withdrew To mine room again; making bold, My fears forgetting manners, unseal Their grand commission; I found, Horatio, Ah, royal knavery! — exact command, Larded many several sorts reasons Importing Denmark's health England's too, With ho! bugs goblins life, That, supervise, leisure bated, No, stay grinding axe, My head struck off. Here's commission: read leisure. But wilt thou hear I proceed? Being thus be-netted round villainies — Or I could make prologue brains, They begun play — I sat down, Devised new commission, wrote fair: I hold it, statists do, A baseness write fair laboured much How forget learning, but, sir, It yeoman's service: wilt thou know The effect I wrote? An earnest conjuration king, As England faithful tributary, As love like palm might flourish, As peace still wheaten garland wear And stand comma 'tween amities, And many such-like “As'es great charge, That, view knowing contents. Without debatement further, less, He bearers put sudden death, Not shriving time allowed. Why, even heaven ordinant. I father's signet purse, Which model Danish seal; Folded writ form other, Subscribed it, gave't impression, placed safely, The changeling never known. Now, next day Was sea-fight; sequent Thou know'st already. Why, man, make love employment; They near conscience; defeat Does insinuation grow: 'Tis dangerous baser nature comes Between pass fell incensed points Of mighty opposites. Does not, think thee, stand upon — He hath killed king whored mother, Popped election hopes, Thrown angle proper life, And cozenage — is't perfect conscience, To quit arm? is't damned, To let canker nature come In evil? It short: interim's mine; And man's life's say “One.” But I sorry, good Horatio, That Laertes I forgot myself; For, image cause, I see The portraiture his: I'll court favours: But, sure, bravery grief put Into towering passion. Give pardon, sir: I done wrong; But pardon't, gentleman. This presence knows, And must needs heard, I punished With sore distraction. What I done, That might nature, honour exception Roughly awake, I proclaim madness. Was't Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet: If Hamlet ta'en away, And he's wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet not, Hamlet denies it. Who it, then? His madness: if't so, Hamlet faction wronged; His madness poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, audience, Let disclaiming purposed evil Free far generous thoughts, That I shot arrow o'er house, And hurt brother. I embrace freely; And brothers' wager frankly play. Give us foils. Come on. I'll foil, Laertes: mine ignorance Your skill shall, like star i' darkest night, Stick fiery indeed. No, hand. Very well, lord; Your grace laid odds a' weaker side. This likes well. These foils length? Come on, sir. One. Judgement. I'll play bout first; set awhile. Come. Another hit; say you? Good madam! I dare drink yet, madam; by. Come, third, Laertes: dally; I pray you, pass best violence; I sure make wanton me. Nay, come, again. How queen? O villainy! Ho! let door locked: Treachery! Seek out. The point envenomed too! Then, venom, thy work. Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink potion. Is thy union here? Follow mother. Heaven make thee free it! I follow thee. I dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You look pale tremble chance, That mutes audience act, Had I time — fell sergeant, death, Is strict arrest — O, I could tell But let be. Horatio, I dead; Thou livest; report cause aright To unsatisfied. As th' art man, Give cup: let go; heaven, I'll have't. O good Horatio, wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind If thou didst ever hold thy heart, Absent thee felicity awhile, And harsh world draw thy breath pain, To tell story. What warlike noise this? O, I die, Horatio; The potent poison quite o'ercrows spirit: I cannot live hear news England; But I prophesy election lights On Fortinbras: dying voice; So tell him, occurrents, less, Which solicited. The rest silence.
