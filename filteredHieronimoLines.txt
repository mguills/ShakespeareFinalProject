 HIERONIMO: Long may live serve Sovereign Liege, And soon decay, unless serve Liege. HIERONIMO: That son, gracious sovereign, Of whom, though tender infancy My loving thoughts never hope well, He never pleased father's eyes til now, Nor filled heart over-cloying joys. ... [I.2.120] HIERONIMO: But I know Grace wise, And might seem partial difference, Enforced nature law arms My tongue plead young Horatio's right. He hunted well lion's death, ... [I.2.170] Not garment wore skin; So Hares may pull dead lions beard. HIERONIMO: The first armed knight, hung Scutcheon up, [He takes Scutcheon, gives King.] Was English Robert, Earl Gloucester, Who, King Stephen bore sway Albion, Arrived five twenty thousand men In Portingale, success war Enforced King, Saracen, ... [I.5.30] To bear yoke English monarchy. HIERONIMO: The second knight hung Scutcheon up, [He doth before.] Was Edmund, Earl Kent Albion, When English Richard wore diadem. He came likewise razed Lisbon walls And took King Portingale fight; ... [I.5.40] For such-like service done, He created Duke York. HIERONIMO: The third last, least account [Doing before.] Was, rest, valiant Englishman, Brave John Gaunt, Duke Lancaster, As Scutcheon plainly may appear. ... [I.5.50] He puissant army came Spain, And took King Castile prisoner. HIERONIMO: What outcries pluck naked bed And chill throbbing heart trembling fear, Which never danger yet could daunt before? Who calls Hieronimo? speak, I am, I slumber; therefore twas dream. No, no, woman cried help, And within garden cry, And garden must I rescue her. But stay, murd'rous spectacle this? A man hanged murderers gone: ... [II.5.10] And bower, lay guilt me. This place made pleasure, death. [He cuts down.] Those garments wears I oft seen: Alas, Horatio, sweet son. Oh no, whilom son. Oh, thou call'dst bed? Oh speak, spark life remain. I thy Father; hath slain son? What savage monster, human kind, Hath glutted thy harmless blood, ... [II.5.20] And left thy bloody corpse dishonored here, For me, amidst dark deathful shades, To drown thee ocean tears? Oh heavens, made night cover sin? By day deed darkness been. Oh earth, didst thou time devour The vild profaner sacred bower? Oh poor Horatio, hadst thou misdone To leese thy life, ere life new begun? Oh wicked butcher, whatsoe'er thou wert, ... [II.5.30] How could thou strangle virtue desert? Aye wretched, lost joy In leesing Horatio, sweet boy! [Enter Isabella.] HIERONIMO: Here, Isabella, help lament, For sighs stopped tears spent. HIERONIMO: To know author ease grief, ... [II.5.40] For revenge heart would find relief. HIERONIMO: He supped us tonight, frolic merry. And said would go visit Balthazar At Duke's Palace: Prince doth lodge. He custom stay late: He may chamber; go see. Roderigo, ho. [Enter Pedro Jaques.] HIERONIMO: True, Spain takes note it. ... [II.5.10A] Besides generally beloved; His Majesty day grace With waiting cup: favors, Which assure cannot short-lived. HIERONIMO: I wonder fellow got clothes: Sirrah, sirrah, I'll know truth all: Jaques, run Duke Castile's presently And bid son Horatio come home. I mother strange dreams tonight. Do hear me, sir? HIERONIMO: Well, sir, gone. ... [II.5.20A] Pedro, come hither; knowest thou is? HIERONIMO: Too well, who? it? Peace, Isabella: Nay, blush not, man. HIERONIMO: Ha, ha, St. James, doth make laugh, That deluded myself. HIERONIMO: Aye: I would sworn myself, within hour, That son Horatio: His garments like. Ha! Are great persuasions? ... [II.5.30A] HIERONIMO: Were not, Isabella? dost thou dream is? Can thy soft bosom entertain thought, That black deed mischief done On one pure spotless son? Away, I ashamed. HIERONIMO: It man, sure, hanged here: A youth, I remember: I cut down. ... [II.5.40A] If prove son all. Say you? say you? Light, lend Taper; Let look again. Oh God, Confusion, mischief, torment, death hell, Drop stings cold bosom, That stiff horror; kill quickly: Be gracious me, thou infective night, And drop deed murder me; Gird waste grief thy large darkness, And let survive, see light ... [II.5.50A] May put mind I son. HIERONIMO: How strangely I lost way grief. HIERONIMO: See'st thou handkercher besmeared blood? It shall me, til I take revenge. See'st thou wounds yet bleeding fresh? I'll entomb them, til I revenged. Then I joy amidst discontent; Til sorrow never shall spent. HIERONIMO: Meanwhile, good Isabella, cease thy plaints, ... [II.5.60] Or least, dissemble awhile: So shall sooner find practice out, And learn brought about. Come Isabel, let us take [They take up.] And bear cursed place. I'll say dirge: singing fits case. O aliquis mihi quas pulchrum ver educat herbas [Hieronimo sets breast unto sword.] Misceat, & nostro detur medicina dolori; Aut si qui faciunt annorum oblivia, succos Prebeat; ipse metam magnum quaecungue per orbem ... [II.5.70] Gramina Sol pulchras effert luminis oras; Ipse bibam quicquid meditatur saga veneni, Quicquid & herbarum vi caeca nenia nectit: Omnia perpetiar, lethum quoque, dum semel omnis Noster extincto moriatur pectore sensus. Ergo tuos oculos nunquam (mea vita) videbo, Et tua perpetuus sepelivit lumina somnus? Emoriar tecum: sic, sic juvat ire sub umbras. At tamen absistam properato cedere letho, Ne mortem vindicta tuam tam nulla sequatur. ... [II.5.80] [Here throws [the sword] bears body away.] HIERONIMO: Oh eyes, eyes, fountains fraught tears; Oh life, life, lively form death; Oh world, world, mass public wrongs, Confused filled murder misdeeds. Oh sacred heavens, unhallowed deed, If inhuman barbarous attempt, If incomparable murder thus Of mine, son, Shall unrevealed unrevenged pass, How term dealings just, ... [III.2.10] If unjustly deal those, justice trust? The night, sad secretary moans, With direful visions wakes vexed soul, And wounds distressful son Solicits notice death. The ugly fiends sally forth hell, And frame steps unfrequented paths, And fear heart fierce inflamed thoughts. The cloudy day discontents records, Early begins register dreams, ... [III.2.20] And drive forth seek murtherer. Eyes, life, world, heavens, hell, night day, See, search, show, send man, mean, may -- [A Letter falleth.] What's here? letter? tush, so: A letter written Hieronimo. [Red ink.] For want ink, receive bloody writ: Me hath hapless brother hid thee; Revenge thyself Balthazar him: For murdered thy son. Hieronimo, revenge Horatio's death, ... [III.2.30] And better fare Bel-imperia doth. What means unexpected miracle? My son slain Lorenzo Prince. What cause Horatio malign? Or might move thee, Bel-imperia, To accuse thy brother, mean? Hieronimo, beware, thou art betrayed, And entrap thy life, train laid. Advise thee therefore, credulous: This devised endanger thee, ... [III.2.40] That thou Lorenzo shouldst accuse; And he, thy dishonor done, draw Thy life question thy name hate. Dear life beloved son, And death behoves revenged: Then hazard thine own, Hieronimo, But live t'effect thy resolution. I therefore circumstances try, What I gather, confirm writ; And hearkening near Duke Castile's house, ... [III.2.50] Close, I can, Bel-imperia, To listen nothing bewray. [Enter Pedringano.] Now, Pedringano. HIERONIMO: Where's thy Lady? HIERONIMO: My Lord -- HIERONIMO: Nay, nay, Lord, I thank you, shall need; I suit unto her, late, And disgrace makes unfortunate. HIERONIMO: Oh no, Lord; I dare not; must be: I humbly thank Lordship. HIERONIMO: Who? you, Lord? I reserve favor greater honor; This toy, Lord, toy. HIERONIMO: Y' faith, Lord, tis idle thing I must confess, I ha' slack, tardy, remiss unto honor. HIERONIMO: In troth, Lord, thing nothing: The murder Son, -- A thing nothing, Lord. HIERONIMO: My grief heart, thoughts tongue tell. [Exit.] HIERONIMO: Thus must toil men's extremes, That know remedy own; And justice, unjustly we, For wrongs, compass redress. But shall I never live see day, That I may come (by justice heavens) To know cause may cares allay? This toils body, consumeth age, That I men must be, And neither gods men me. ... [III.6.10 HIERONIMO: So is't duty regard death, Who, lived, deserved dearest blood. But come came for: let's begin; For lies bids gone. [Enter Officers, Boy Pedringano, letter hand, bound.] HIERONIMO: Stand forth, thou monster, murderer men; And here, satisfaction world, Confess thy folly repent thy fault; For there's thy place execution. HIERONIMO: Peace, impudent, thou shalt find so; For blood blood shall, I sit judge, Be satisfied, law discharged. And though cannot receive like, Yet I see others right. Dispatch: fault's approved confessed, And law condemned die. ... [III.6.40] HIERONIMO: I seen wretch impudent. Oh monstrous times, murder's set light, ... [III.6.90] And soul, shrined heaven, Solely delights interdicted things, Still wand'ring thorny passages, That intercepts happiness. Murder, oh bloody monster! God forbid A fault foul 'scape unpunished. Dispatch, see execution done. This makes remember thee, son. [Exit Hieronimo.] HIERONIMO: Where shall I run breathe abroad woes, My woes, whose weight hath wearied earth? Or mine exclaims, surcharged air With ceaseless plaints deceased son? The blust'ring winds, conspiring words, At lament moved leafless trees, Disrobed meadows flowered green, Made mountains marsh spring-tides tears And broken brazen gates hell. Yet still tormented tortured soul ... [III.7.10] With broken sighs restless passions That winged mount; and, hovering air, Beat windows brightest heavens, Soliciting justice revenge: But placed imperial heights, Where, countermured walls diamond, I find place impregnable; Resist woes give words way. [Enter Hangman letter.] HIERONIMO: Well, him? HIERONIMO: I warrant thee, give me. HIERONIMO: Aye, aye. HIERONIMO: And yet, though somewhat nearer concerns, I will, ease grief I sustain, ... [III.7.30] Take truce sorrow I read this. 'My Lord, I write mine extremes required, That would labor delivery; If neglect, life desperate, And death I shall reveal troth. You know, Lord, I slew sake, And confederate Prince you; Won rewards hopeful promises, I help murder Don Horatio too.' Help murder mine Horatio? ... [III.7.40] And actors th' accursed Tragedy Wast thou, Lorenzo, Balthazar thou, Of son, son deserved well? What I heard, mine eyes beheld? Oh sacred heavens, may come pass That monstrous detested deed, So closely smothered, long concealed, Shall thus venged revealed? Now see I I durst suspect, That Bel-imperia's Letter feigned. ... [III.7.50] Nor feigned she, though falsely wronged Both her, myself, Horatio, themselves. Now may I make compare 'twixt this, Of every accident I ne'er could find Til now, I feelingly perceive They heaven unpunished would leave. Oh false Lorenzo: thy flattering looks? Is honor thou didst son? And Balthazar, bane soul me: Was ransom reserved thee for? ... [III.7.60] Woe cause constrained wars; Woe thy baseness captivity; Woe thy birth, thy body, thy soul, Thy cursed father, thy conquered self; And banned bitter execrations The day place pity thee. But wherefore waste I mine unfruitful words, When naught blood satisfy woes? I go plain Lord King, And cry aloud justice Court, ... [III.7.70] Wearing flints withered feet; And either purchase justice entreats, Or tire revenging threats. [Exit.] HIERONIMO: Tis neither think, think, Nor think; wide all: These slippers mine, son Horatio's. My son -- what's son? A thing begot Within pair minutes, thereabout: A lump bred darkness, doth serve To ballace light creatures call women; And nine months' end, creeps forth light. What yet son, To make father dote, rave, run mad? ... [III.11.10A] Being born, pouts, cries, breeds teeth. What yet son? He must fed, Be taught go, speak. Aye, yet? Why might man love calf well? Or melt passion o'er frisking kid, As son? Methinks, young bacon, Or fine little smooth horse-colt, Should move man much doth son. For one these, little time, Will grow good use; whereas son, ... [III.11.20A] The grows stature years, The unsquared, unbeveled, appears, Reckons parents among rank fools, Strikes care upon heads mad riots, Makes look old meet age. This son -- And loss this, considered truly? -- Oh, Horatio Grew reach insatiate humors: He loved loving parents; ... [III.11.30A] He comfort, mother's joy, The arm hold house: Our hopes stored him, None damned murderer could hate him. He seen back nineteen year, When strong arm unhorsed proud Prince Balthazar, And great mind, full Honor, Took unto mercy: That valiant, ignoble Portingale. Well, heaven heaven still. ... [III.11.40A] And Nemesis, Furies, And things called whips, And sometimes meet murderers: They always 'scape, comfort, Aye, aye, aye; time steals on, And steals, steals, Til violence leaps forth like thunder Wrapped ball fire, And doth bring confusion all. HIERONIMO: The next way me. HIERONIMO: Oh, hard by: tis yon house see. HIERONIMO: Who, Lord Lorenzo? HIERONIMO: Oh, forbear, For talk us far fitter were. But importunate know ... [III.11.10] The way find out, Then list me, I'll resolve doubt. There path upon left-hand side That leadeth guilty conscience Unto forest distrust fear, A darksome place, dangerous pass: There shall meet melancholy thoughts, Whose baleful humors uphold, It conduct despair death: Whose rocky cliffs beheld, ... [III.11.20] Within hugy dale lasting night, That, kindled world's iniquities, Doth cast filthy detested fumes: -- Not far thence, murderers built A habitation cursed souls, There, brazen cauldron, fixed Jove, In fell wrath, upon sulfur flame, Yourselves shall find Lorenzo bathing In boiling lead blood innocents. HIERONIMO: Ha, ha, ha! ... [III.11.30] Why, ha, ha, ha! Farewell, good ha, ha, ha. [Exit.] HIERONIMO: Now, sir, perhaps I come see King; The King sees me, fain would hear suit; Why, strange seld-seen thing, That standers-by toys strike mute? Go to, I see shifts say more. Hieronimo, tis time thee trudge: Down dale flows purple gore, Standeth fiery Tower; sits judge Upon seat steel molten brass, And 'twixt teeth holds fire-brand ... [III.12.10] That leads unto lake hell doth stand. Away, Hieronimo! To gone: He'll thee justice Horatio's death. Turn path: thou shalt straight; Or this, thou needst take thy breath: This way, way -- soft fair, so: For I hang kill myself, let's know Who revenge Horatio's murder then? No, no; fie, no: pardon me, I'll none that. [He flings away dagger halter.] This way I'll take, way comes King, ... [III.12.20] [He takes again.] And I'll fling him, that's flat. And Balthazar, I'll thee bring, And thee, Lorenzo. Here's King -- nay, stay, And here, aye -- goes hare away. [Enter King, Ambassador, Castile. Lorenzo.] HIERONIMO: Justice, oh, justice Hieronimo. HIERONIMO: Oh, so? HIERONIMO: Not I. Hieronimo beware; goe by, goe by. HIERONIMO: Horatio, calls Horatio? ... [III.12.60] HIERONIMO: Justice, Oh, justice, justice, gentle King. HIERONIMO: Justice! Oh justice: Oh son, son, My son, naught ransom redeem. HIERONIMO: Away, Lorenzo, hinder more. For thou hast made bankrupt bliss. Give son; shall ransom him. ... [III.12.70] Away, I'll rip bowels earth, [He diggeth dagger.] And ferry th' Elysian plains, And bring son show deadly wounds. Stand me; I'll make pickaxe poniard, And surrender marshalship; For I'll go marshal fiends hell, To avenged this. HIERONIMO: Nay, soft fair; shall need strive; Needs must go devils drive. [Exit.] HIERONIMO: I pry every crevice wall, Look tree search every brake, Beat bushes, stamp grandam earth, Dive water stare heaven: ... [III.12.20A] Yet cannot I behold son Horatio. -- How now, who's there? Spirits, spirits? HIERONIMO: What make torches dark? HIERONIMO: No, no, deceived -- I -- deceived. Was I mad bid light torches now? Light torches mid noon, Whenas sun-god rides glory: Light torches then. HIERONIMO: Let burnt; night murderous slut That would treasons seen; And yonder pale-faced Hecate there, Moon, Doth give consent done darkness; And Stars gaze upon face Are aeglets sleeve, pins train; And powerful divine Do sleep darkness, shine. HIERONIMO: Villain, thou liest, thou dost nought But tell I mad: Thou liest, I mad! I know thee Pedro, Jaques. I'll prove thee; I mad, could I? Where night Horatio Was murdered? She shone: Search thou book. Had moon shone boy's face kind grace, That I know -- nay, I know -- murderer seen him, His weapon would fall'n cut earth, ... [III.12.50A] Had framed naught blood death. Alack, mischief doth knows what, What shall say mischief? [Enter Isabella.] HIERONIMO: Indeed, Isabella, nothing here; I cry: ask Pedro, ask Jaques; Not I, indeed; merry, merry. ISABELLA: How? Be merry here, merry here? Is place, tree, ... [III.12.60A] Where Horatio died, murdered? HIERONIMO: Was -- say what: let weep out. This tree; I set kernel: And hot Spain could let grow, But infant human sap Began wither, duly twice morning Would I sprinkling fountain-water. At last grew, grew, bore, bore, Til length It grew gallows, bear sonne, ... [III.12.70A] It bore thy fruit mine: oh wicked, wicked plant. [One knocks within door.] See knocks there. HIERONIMO: Bid come in, paint comfort, For surely there's none lives painted comfort. Let come in. One knows may chance: Gods I set tree -- even Masters' ungrateful servants rear nought, And hate bring up. [Enter Painter.] HIERONIMO: Wherefore, why, thou scornful villain? How, where, means I blest? ... [III.12.80A] HIERONIMO: Oh ambitious beggar, wouldst thou That lives world? Why, undelved mines cannot buy An ounce justice; tis jewel inestimable. I tell thee, God hath engrossed justice hands, And none comes him. HIERONIMO: How, thy son murdered? HIERONIMO: What, thine? That's lie As massy earth: I son Whose least unvalued hair weigh A thousand thy son's: murdered. HIERONIMO: Nor I, I: one mine Was worth legion. But one. Pedro, Jaques, go a-doors; Isabella, go, And good fellow I Will range hideous orchard down, ... [III.12.100A] Like two Lions reaved young. Go a-doors, I say. [Exeunt. The painter sits down.] Come, let's talk wisely now. Was thy son murdered? HIERONIMO: So mine. How dost take it? Art thou sometimes mad? Is tricks comes thine eyes? HIERONIMO: Art Painter? canst paint tear, wound, groan sigh? Canst paint tree this? HIERONIMO: Bazardo, afore-god, excellent fellow. Look you, sir, see, I'd paint [for] Gallery, oil colors matted, draw five years younger I -- ye see, sir, let five years go, let go like Marshal Spain -- wife Isabella standing me, speaking look son Horatio, intend such-like purpose: 'God bless thee, sweet son,' hand leaning upon head, thus, sir. Do see? may done? HIERONIMO: Nay, I pray, mark me, sir: then, sir, would I paint tree, tree. Canst paint doleful cry? HIERONIMO: Nay, cry; one. Well, sir, paint youth run villain's swords, hanging upon tree. Canst thou draw murderer? HIERONIMO: Oh, let worse, worse: stretch thine Art, let beards Judas color; let ... [III.112.130A] eyebrows jutty over: case observe that. Then, sir, violent noise, bring forth shirt, gown mine arm, torch hand sword reared thus: words: 'What noise this? Who calls Hieronimo?' May done? HIERONIMO: Well, sir; bring forth, bring alley alley, still distracted countenance going along, let hair heave night-cap. Let Clouds scowl, make Moon dark, Stars extinct, Winds blowing, Bells tolling, Owl shrieking, Toads croaking, minutes ... [III.12.140A] jarring, clock striking twelve. And last, sir, starting, behold man hanging, tottering, tottering, know wind wave man, I trice cut down. And looking upon advantage torch, find son Horatio. There may [show] passion, may show passion. Draw like old Priam Troy, crying: 'the house a-fire, house a-fire, torch head!' Make curse, make rave, make cry, make mad, make well again, make curse hell, invocate heaven, end leave trance -- forth. HIERONIMO: Oh no, end: end death madness. As I never better I mad; methinks I brave fellow; I wonders: reason abuseth me, there's torment, there's hell. At last, sir, bring one murderers; strong Hector, thus would I tear drag drown. [He beats painter in, comes Book hand.] HIERONIMO: Vindicta mihi! Aye, heaven revenged every ill; Nor suffer murder unrepaid. Then stay, Hieronimo, attend will: For mortal men may appoint time. Per scelus semper tutum est sceleribus iter. Strike, strike home, wrong offered thee; For evils unto ills conductors be, And death's worst resolution. For thinks patience contend ... [III.13.10] To quiet life, life shall easily end. -- Fata si miseros juvant, habes salutem; Fata si vitam negant, habes sepulchrum: If destiny thy miseries ease, Then hast thou health, happy shalt thou be: If destiny deny thee life, Hieronimo, Yet shalt thou assured tomb: If neither, yet let thy comfort be, Heaven covereth hath burial. And conclude, I revenge death, ... [III.13.20] But how? vulgar wits men, With open, inevitable ills, As secret, yet certain mean, Which kind-ship cloaked best. Wise men take opportunity, Closely safely fitting things time. But extremes advantage hath time. And therefore times fit revenge Thus therefore I rest unrest, Dissembling quiet unquietness, ... [III.13.30] Not seeming I know villainies, That simplicity may make think That ignorantly I let slip: For ignorance, I wot, well know, Remedium malorum iners est. Nor ought avails menace Who, wintry storm upon plain, Will bear nobility. No, no, Hieronimo, thou must enjoin Thine eyes observation, thy tongue ... [III.13.40] To milder speeches thy spirit affords; Thy heart patience thy hands rest, Thy Cap courtesy, thy knee bow, Til revenge thou know when, where, how. [A noise within.] How now, noise? What coil keep? [Enter Servant.] HIERONIMO: That I plead several actions? Why, let enter, let see them. ... [III.13.50] [Enter three Citizens, old Man.] HIERONIMO: Come near, men, thus importune me. -- [Aside.] Now must I bear face gravity, For thus I used, Marshalship, To plead causes Corregidor. -- Come on, sirs, what's matter? HIERONIMO: Of Battery? HIERONIMO: Give place. ... [III.13.60] HIERONIMO: Content you, sirs; determined That I plead several actions? HIERONIMO: But wherefore stands yon silly man mute, With mournful eyes hands heaven upreared? Come hither, father, let know thy cause. HIERONIMO: Say, father, tell what's thy suit? HIERONIMO: What's here? 'The humble supplication Of Don Bazulto murdered son.' HIERONIMO: No, sir, murdered son, ... [III.13.80] Oh son, son, Oh son Horatio. But mine, thine, Bazulto, content. Here, take handercher, wipe thine eyes, Whiles wretched I thy mishaps may see The lively portrait dying self. [He draweth bloody napkin.] Oh no, this; Horatio, thine; And I dyed thy dearest blood, This token twixt thy soul me, That thy death revenged I be. But here, take this, -- what, purse? -- ... [III.13.90] Aye this, that, thine; For one extremities. HIERONIMO: See, see, oh see thy shame, Hieronimo; See loving father son: Behold sorrows sad laments That delivereth son's decease. If love's effects strives lesser things, If love enforce moods meaner wits, ... [III.13.100] If love express power poor estates; Hieronimo, when, raging Sea, Tossed wind tide, o'erturnest The upper billows' course waves keep, Whilest lesser waters labor deep: Then shamest thou not, Hieronimo, neglect The sweet revenge thy Horatio? Though earth justice found, I'll hell, passion Knock dismal gates Pluto's court, ... [III.13.110] Getting force, Alcides did, A troop furies tormenting hags, To torture Don Lorenzo rest. Yet lest triple-headed porter Deny passage slimy strand, The Thracian poet thou shalt counterfeit. Come on, old father, Orpheus, And thou canst notes upon Harp, Then sound burden thy sore heart's grief, Til gain Proserpine may grant Revenge murdered son. ... [III.13.120] Then I rent tear them, thus, thus, Shivering limbs pieces teeth. [Tear Papers.] HIERONIMO: That cannot be, I gave never wound; Show one drop blood fall same: How possible I slay then? ... [III.13.130] Tush, no; run after, catch can. [Exeunt old man. Bazulto remains til Hieronimo enters again, who, staring face, speaks.] HIERONIMO: And art thou come, Horatio, depth, To ask justice upper earth, To tell thy father thou art unrevenged, To wring tears Isabella's eyes, Whose lights dimmed over-long laments? Go back, son, complain Aecus; For here's justice; gentle boy, gone, For justice exiled earth: Hieronimo bear thee company. ... [III.13.140] Thy mother cries righteous Rhadamanth For revenge murderers. HIERONIMO: But let look Horatio. Sweet boy, art thou changed death's black shade. Had Proserpine pity thy youth, But suffered thy fair crimson-colored spring With withered winter blasted thus? Horatio, thou art older thy father: Ah, ruthless fate, favor thus transforms. ... [III.13.150] HIERONIMO: What, son? thou fury art, Sent empty Kingdom black night, To summon make appearance Before grim Minos Rhadamanth, To plague Hieronimo, remiss, And seeks vengeance Horatio's death. HIERONIMO: Aye, I know thee, thou namest thy son; ... [III.13.160] Thou art lively image grief; Within thy face, sorrows I may see. Thy eyes gummed tears, thy cheeks wan, Thy forehead troubled, thy mutt'ring lips Murmur sad words abruptly broken By force windy sighs thy spirit breathes; And sorrow riseth thy son; And self-same sorrow feel I son. Come in, old man, thou shalt Isabel; Lean arm; I thee, thou me, shalt stay, ... [III.13.170] And thou, I sing song, Three parts one, discords framed: -- Talk cords, let us gone, For cord Horatio slain. [Exeunt.] HIERONIMO: And where's Duke? HIERONIMO: Even so. -- What new device devised, trow? Pocas Palabras, mild Lamb: Is't I revenged? no, I man. HIERONIMO: My Lords, I thank Horatio. HIERONIMO: What, short? Then I'll gone, I thank for't. HIERONIMO: With me, sir? Lord, I thought done. HIERONIMO: Why, miserable thing, Lord? HIERONIMO: Your son Lorenzo? whom, noble Lord? The hope Spain, mine honorable friend? ... [III.14.140] Grant combat dare: [Draws sword.] I'll meet face-to-face, tell so. These scandalous reports As love me, hate Lord much. Should I suspect Lorenzo would prevent Or cross suit, loved son well? My Lord, I ashamed said. HIERONIMO: My good Lord, I know not. HIERONIMO: Aye, marry, Lord, shall. Friends, quoth he? see, I'll friends all: Specially you, lovely Lord; For divers causes fit us That friends: world suspicious, ... [III.14.160] And men may think imagine not. HIERONIMO: What else? shame so. HIERONIMO: Your Lordship's command. Pah: keep way: Chi mi fa piu carezze che non suole, Tradito mi ha, tradir mi voule. [Exit.] HIERONIMO: But may Bel-imperia ... [IV.1.30] Vows revenge hath deigned say? Why I see heaven applies drift, And Saints sit soliciting For vengeance cursed murderers. Madam, tis true, I find so, I found letter, written name, And Letter, Horatio died. Pardon, O pardon, Bel-imperia, My fear care believing it; Nor think I thoughtless think upon mean ... [IV.1.40] To let death unrevenged full: And I vow -- give consent, And conceal resolution -- I erelong determine deaths That causeless thus murdered son. HIERONIMO: On then; whatsoever I devise, Let entreat you, grace practices: ... [IV.1.50] For plot's already mine head. Here are. [Enter Balthazar Lorenzo.] HIERONIMO: Aye, Lord; courting as, I promise you, She hath heart, you, Lord, hers. HIERONIMO: My help? Why, good Lords, assure me; For given cause; aye, faith, you. HIERONIMO: Is all? HIERONIMO: Why then, I'll fit you; say more. When I young, I gave mind ... [IV.1.70] And plied fruitless Poetry; Which though profit professor naught, Yet passing pleasing world. HIERONIMO: Marry, good Lord, thus: (And yet, methinks, quick us): -- When Toledo I studied, It chance write Tragedy, See here, Lords -- [He shows book.] Which, long forgot, I found day. Now would Lordships favor much ... [IV.1.80] As grace acting -- I mean one play part -- Assure prove passing strange, And wondrous plausible assembly. HIERONIMO: Why, Nero thought disparagement, And Kings Emperors ta'en delight To make experience wits plays. HIERONIMO: Now, good Lord, could entreat Your sister Bel-imperia make one? For what's play without woman it? HIERONIMO: Why well: I tell you, Lordings, It determined acted ... [IV.1.100] By Gentlemen scholars too, Such could tell speak. HIERONIMO: That shall I roundly. The Chronicles Spain Record written Knight Rhodes: He betrothed, wedded length, To one Perseda, Italian Dame, ... [IV.1.110] Whose beauty ravished beheld, Especially soul Soliman, Who marriage chiefest guest. By sundry means sought Soliman win Perseda's love, could gain same. Then 'gan break passions friend, One Bashaws held full dear; Her Bashaw long solicited, And saw otherwise won, But husband's death, Knight Rhodes, ... [IV.1.120] Whom presently treachery slew. She, stirred exceeding hate therefore, As cause this, slew Soliman, And, escape Bashaw's tyranny, Did stab herself, Tragedy. HIERONIMO: Marry, thus: Moved remorse misdeeds, Ran mountain-top, hung himself. ... [IV.1.130] HIERONIMO: Oh, I, Lords, make doubt it: I'll play murderer, I warrant you; For I already conceited that. HIERONIMO: Great Soliman, Turkish Emperor. HIERONIMO: Erastus, Knight Rhodes. HIERONIMO: Perseda, chaste resolute. -- And here, Lords, several abstracts drawn, ... [IV.1.140] For note parts, And act it, occasion's offered you. You must provide Turkish cap, A black mustachio, Falchion; [Gives paper Balthazar.] You, Cross, like Knight Rhodes; [Gives another Lorenzo.] And Madam, must attire yourself, [He giveth Bel-imperia another.] Like Phoebe, Flora, huntress, Which discretion shall seem best. And me, Lords, I'll look one, And ransom Viceroy sent, ... [IV.1.150] So furnish perform Tragedy, As world shall say, Hieronimo Was liberal gracing so. HIERONIMO: A Comedy? Fie, Comedies fit common wits: But present Kingly troop withal, Give stately-written Tragedy; Tragedia cothurnata, fitting Kings, Containing matter, common things. ... [IV.1.160] My Lords, must perfourmed, As fitting first night's reveling. The Italian Tragedians sharp wit That one hour's meditation They would perform anything action. HIERONIMO: In Paris? Mass, well remembered. There's one thing rests us do. HIERONIMO: Each one us must act part In unknown languages, That may breed variety: As you, Lord, Latin, I Greek, You Italian, I know That Bel-imperia hath practiced French, In courtly French shall phrases be. HIERONIMO: It must so; conclusion Shall prove intention, good: And I Oration, And strange wondrous show besides, That I behind curtain, Assure yourself, shall make matter known: And shall concluded one Scene, For there's pleasure ta'en tediousness. HIERONIMO: You'll ply gear? HIERONIMO: Why so: Now shall I see fall Babylon, Wrought heavens confusion. And world like tragedy, Hard hap old Hieronimo. [Exit.] HIERONIMO: Oh sir, author's credit, To look things may go well. But, good Lord, let entreat grace To give King copy play: This argument show. HIERONIMO: One thing more, good Lord. HIERONIMO: Let entreat grace ... [IV.3.10] That, train passed gallery, You would vouchsafe throw key. HIERONIMO: What, ready, Balthazar? Bring chair cushion King. [Enter Balthazar chair.] Well done, Balthazar, Hang Title: Our scene Rhodes: -- what, beard on? HIERONIMO: Dispatch, shame; long? ... [IV.3.20] [Exit Balthazar.] Bethink thyself, Hieronimo, Recall thy wits, recompt thy former wrongs Thou hast received murder thy son. And lastly, least, Isabel, Once mother thy dearest wife, All woe-begone him, hath slain herself. Behooves thee then, Hieronimo, revenged. The plot laid dire revenge: On, then, Hieronimo, pursue revenge, For nothing wants acting revenge. [Exit Hieronimo.] HIERONIMO: 'Whatever joy earth yields, betide Majesty.' HIERONIMO: 'Let Perseda grace attend.' HIERONIMO: 'Remove Erasto, mighty Soliman, And Perseda quickly won.' HIERONIMO: 'Let Erasto live grieve great Soliman.' HIERONIMO: 'But rival, let die.' HIERONIMO: 'Erasto, Soliman saluteth thee, ... [IV.4.50] And lets thee wit highness' will, Which is, thou shouldest thus employed.' [Stab him.] HIERONIMO: But Bel-imperia plays Perseda well. HIERONIMO: Marry, follows Hieronimo: Here break sundry languages, And thus conclude I vulgar tongue. Happily think -- bootless thoughts -- That fabulously counterfeit, And Tragedians do: To die today fashioning Scene -- The death Ajax Roman peer -- ... [IV.4.80] And minute starting again, Revive please tomorrow's audience. No, Princes; know I Hieronimo, The hopeless father hapless Son, Whose tongue tuned tell latest tale, Not excuse gross errors play. I see looks urge instance words; Behold reason urging this: [Shows dead son.] See show, look spectacle: Here lay hope, hope hath end: ... [IV.4.90] Here lay heart, heart slain: Here lay treasure, treasure lost: Here lay bliss, bliss bereft: But hope, heart, treasure, joy bliss, All fled, failed, died, yea, decayed this. From forth wounds came breath gave life; They murdered made fatal marks. The cause love, whence grew mortal hate; The hate: Lorenzo young Balthazar: The love: son Bel-imperia. ... [IV.4.100] But night, coverer accursed crimes, With pitchy silence hushed traitors' harms, And lent leave, sorted leisure To take advantage Garden-plot Upon Son, dear Horatio: There merciless butchered boy, In black dark night, pale dim, cruel death. He shrieks: I heard, yet, methinks, I hear His dismal out-cry echo air. With soonest speed I hasted noise, ... [IV.4.110] Where hanging tree I found son, Through-girt wounds, slaughtered see. And grieved I (think you) spectacle? Speak, Portuguese, whose loss resembles mine: If thou canst weep upon thy Balthazar, Tis like I wailed Horatio. And you, L[ord], whose reconciled son Marched net, thought unseen, And rated brain-sick lunacy, With 'God amend mad Hieronimo,' ... [IV.4.120] How brook play's Catastrophe? And behold bloody handkercher, Which Horatio's death I weeping dipped Within river bleeding wounds. It propitious, see, I reserved, And never hath left bloody heart, Soliciting remembrance vow With these, Oh, accursed murderers: Which, performed, heart satisfied. And end Bashaw I became, That might revenge Lorenzo's life, ... [IV.4.130] Who therefore appointed part, And represent Knight Rhodes, That I might kill conveniently. So, Viceroy, thus Balthazar, thy Son, That Soliman Bel-imperia, In person Perseda, murdered: Solely appointed tragic part That might slay offended her. Poor Bel-imperia missed part this, ... [IV.4.140] For though story saith died, Yet I kindness, care her, Did otherwise determine end; But love him, hate much Did urge resolution such. And, Princes, behold Hieronimo, Author actor Tragedy, Bearing latest fortune fist; And resolute conclude part As Actors gone before. ... [IV.4.150] And, Gentles, thus I end play; Urge words, I say. [He runs hang himself.] HIERONIMO: Viceroy, I trust thee life, Which I day offered son. ... [IV.4.160] Accused wretch, Why stayest thou resolved die? HIERONIMO: Oh, good words: dear Horatio, As yours, yours, yours, L[ord], you, My guiltless Son Lorenzo slain, ... [IV.4.170] And Lorenzo Balthazar Am I last revenged thoroughly, Upon whose souls may heavens yet avenged With greater far afflictions. HIERONIMO: What lesser liberty kings afford Than harmless silence? afford me. ... [IV.4.180] Sufficeth, I may not, I tell thee. HIERONIMO: Indeed thou mayest torment me, wretched Son Hath done murd'ring Horatio: But never shall thou force reveal The thing I vowed inviolate. And therefore, despite thy threats, Pleased deaths, eased revenge, First take tongue, afterwards heart. ... [IV.4.190] HIERONIMO: But sure dead? HIERONIMO: What, too? HIERONIMO: Nay, I care not; come, shall friends; Let us lay heads together: See, here's goodly noose hold all. HIERONIMO: Secure? doest thou wonder it? ... [IV.4.9A] I tell thee, Viceroy, day I seen revenge, And sight grown prouder monarch Than ever sat Crown Spain. Had I many lives Stars, As many heavens go to, lives, I'd give all, aye, soul boot, But I would see thee ride red pool. HIERONIMO: Oh, good words: dear Horatio, As yours, yours, yours, L[ord], you, My guiltless Son Lorenzo slain, ... [IV.4.170] And Lorenzo Balthazar Am I last revenged thoroughly, Upon whose souls may heavens yet avenged With greater far afflictions. HIERONIMO: Methinks, since I grew inward Revenge, ... [IV.4.191] I cannot look scorn enough Death. HIERONIMO: Do, do, do; meantime I'll torture you. You Son (as I take it), Son Should ha'e married daughter: ha, wast so? You Son too, Liege's Nephew; He proud politic. Had lived, He might come wear crown Spain -- I thinke 'twas so: 'twas I killed him; ... [IV.4.200] Look you, hand 'twas stabbed His heart -- ye see? hand -- For one Horatio, ever knew him: A youth, one hanged father's garden, One force valiant Son yield, While valiant Son take prisoner. HIERONIMO: Now I applaud I acted. ... [IV.4.210] Nunc iners cadat manus. Now express rupture part, First take tongue afterwards heart. [He bites tongue.]
