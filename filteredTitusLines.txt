 TITUS Hail Rome, victorious thy mourning weeds! Lo, bark hath discharged fraught Returns precious lading bay From whence first weighed anchorage, Cometh Andronicus, bound laurel boughs, To resalute country tears, Tears true joy return Rome. Thou great defender Capitol, Stand gracious rites intend. Romans, five-and-twenty valiant sons, Half number King Priam had, Behold poor remains alive dead. These survive let Rome reward love; These I bring unto latest home, With burial amongst ancestors. Here Goths given leave sheathe sword. Titus, unkind careless thine own, Why suffer'st thou thy sons unburied yet To hover dreadful shore Styx? Make way lay brethren. [They open tomb.] There greet silence, dead wont, And sleep peace, slain country's wars. O sacred receptacle joys, Sweet cell virtue nobility, How many sons hast thou mine store That thou wilt never render more? TITUS I give you, noblest survives, The eldest son distressed queen. TITUS Patient yourself, madam, pardon me. These brethren Goths beheld Alive dead, brethren slain Religiously ask sacrifice. To son marked, die must, T' appease groaning shadows gone. TITUS Let so. And let Andronicus Make latest farewell souls. [Sound trumpets, lay coffin tomb.] In peace honor rest here, sons, Rome's readiest champions, repose rest, Secure worldly chances mishaps. Here lurks treason, envy swells, Here grow damned drugs; storms, No noise, silence eternal sleep. In peace honor rest here, sons. TITUS Kind Rome, hast thus lovingly reserved The cordial mine age glad heart!-- Lavinia, live, outlive thy father's days And fame's eternal date, virtue's praise. [Lavinia rises.] TITUS Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus. TITUS A better head glorious body fits Than shakes age feebleness. [To Tribunes Senators aloft.] What, I robe trouble you? Be chosen proclamations today, Tomorrow yield rule, resign life, And set abroad new business all? Rome, I thy soldier forty years, And led country's strength successfully, And buried one twenty valiant sons, Knighted field, slain manfully arms, In right service noble country. Give staff honor mine age, But scepter control world. Upright held it, lords, held last. TITUS Content thee, prince. I restore thee The people's hearts wean themselves. TITUS People Rome, people's tribunes here, I ask voices suffrages. Will bestow friendly Andronicus? TITUS Tribunes, I thank you, suit I make: That create emperor's eldest son, Lord Saturnine, whose virtues will, I hope, Reflect Rome Titan's rays Earth And ripen justice commonweal. Then, elect advice, Crown say "Long live emperor." TITUS It doth, worthy lord, match I hold highly honored Grace; And sight Rome Saturnine, King commander commonweal, The wide world's emperor, I consecrate My sword, chariot, prisoners, Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord. Receive them, then, tribute I owe, Mine honor's ensigns humbled thy feet. TITUS How, sir? Are earnest then, lord? TITUS Traitors, avaunt! Where Emperor's guard? TITUS Nor thou sons mine. My sons would never dishonor me. Traitor, restore Lavinia Emperor. TITUS O monstrous! What reproachful words these? TITUS These words razors wounded heart. TITUS I bid wait upon bride. Titus, wert thou wont walk alone, Dishonored thus challenged wrongs? TITUS No, foolish tribune, no; son mine, Nor thou, confederates deed That hath dishonored family. Unworthy brother unworthy sons! TITUS Traitors, away! He rests tomb. This monument five hundred years hath stood, Which I sumptuously reedified. Here none soldiers Rome's servitors Repose fame, none basely slain brawls. Bury can. He comes here. TITUS "And shall"? What villain spake word? TITUS What, would bury despite? TITUS Marcus, even thou hast struck upon crest, And boys mine honor thou hast wounded. My foes I repute every one. So trouble more, get gone. TITUS Speak thou more, rest speed. TITUS I know not, Marcus, I know is. Whether device no, heavens tell. Is beholding man That brought high good turn far? Yes, nobly remunerate. TITUS Prince Bassianus, leave plead deeds. 'Tis thou, those, dishonored me. Rome righteous heavens judge How I loved honored Saturnine. [He kneels.] TITUS Tomorrow, please Majesty To hunt panther hart me, With horn hound we'll give Grace bonjour. TITUS The hunt up, moon bright gray, The fields fragrant, woods green. Uncouple here, let us make bay And wake Emperor lovely bride, And rouse Prince, ring hunter's peal, That court may echo noise. Sons, let charge, ours, To attend Emperor's person carefully. I troubled sleep night, But dawning day new comfort hath inspired. TITUS Many good morrows Majesty;-- Madam, many, good.-- I promised Grace hunter's peal. TITUS And I horse follow game Makes way runs like swallows o'er plain. TITUS I did, lord, yet let bail, For father's reverend tomb I vow They shall ready Highness' To answer suspicion lives. TITUS Hear me, grave fathers; noble tribunes, stay. For pity mine age, whose youth spent In dangerous wars whilst securely slept; For blood Rome's great quarrel shed, For frosty nights I watched, And bitter tears see, Filling aged wrinkles cheeks, Be pitiful condemned sons, Whose souls corrupted 'tis thought. For two-and-twenty sons I never wept Because died honor's lofty bed. [Andronicus lieth down, Judges pass him.] [They exit prisoners Titus continues speaking.] For these, tribunes, dust I write My heart's deep languor soul's sad tears. Let tears stanch earth's dry appetite. My sons' sweet blood make shame blush. O Earth, I befriend thee rain That shall distil two ancient ruins Than youthful April shall showers. In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still; In winter warm tears I'll melt snow And keep eternal springtime thy face, So thou refuse drink dear sons' blood. TITUS Ah, Lucius, thy brothers let plead.-- Grave tribunes, I entreat you-- TITUS Why, 'tis matter, man. If hear, They would mark me; mark, They would pity me. Yet plead I must, And bootless unto them. Therefore I tell sorrows stones, Who, though cannot answer distress, Yet sort better Tribunes, For intercept tale. When I weep, humbly feet Receive tears seem weep me, And attired grave weeds, Rome could afford tribunes like these. A stone soft wax, tribunes hard stones; A stone silent offendeth not, And tribunes tongues doom men death. But wherefore stand'st thou thy weapon drawn? TITUS Will consume me? Let see it, then. TITUS Faint-hearted boy, arise look upon her.-- Speak, Lavinia. What accursed hand Hath made thee handless thy father's sight? What fool hath added water sea Or brought faggot bright-burning Troy? My grief height thou cam'st, And like Nilus disdaineth bounds.-- Give sword. I'll chop hands too, For fought Rome vain; And nursed woe feeding life; In bootless prayer held up, And served effectless use. Now service I require Is one help cut other.-- 'Tis well, Lavinia, thou hast hands, For hands Rome service vain. TITUS It dear, wounded Hath hurt killed dead. For I stand one upon rock, Environed wilderness sea, Who marks waxing tide grow wave wave, Expecting ever envious surge Will brinish bowels swallow him. This way death wretched sons gone; Here stands son banished man, And brother, weeping woes. But gives soul greatest spurn Is dear Lavinia, dearer soul. Had I seen thy picture plight It would madded me. What shall I do, Now I behold thy lively body so? Thou hast hands wipe away thy tears, Nor tongue tell hath martyred thee. Thy husband dead, death Thy brothers condemned, dead this.-- Look, Marcus!--Ah, son Lucius, look her! When I name brothers, fresh tears Stood cheeks doth honeydew Upon gathered lily almost withered. TITUS If kill thy husband, joyful, Because law hath ta'en revenge them.-- No, no, would foul deed. Witness sorrow sister makes.-- Gentle Lavinia, let kiss thy lips, Or make sign I may thee ease. Shall thy good uncle thy brother Lucius And thou I sit round fountain, Looking downwards behold cheeks, How stained like meadows yet dry With miry slime left flood? And fountain shall gaze long Till fresh taste taken clearness And made brine pit bitter tears? Or shall cut away hands like thine? Or shall bite tongues dumb shows Pass remainder hateful days? What shall do? Let us tongues Plot device misery To make us wondered time come. TITUS Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot Thy napkin cannot drink tear mine, For thou, poor man, hast drowned thine own. TITUS Mark, Marcus, mark. I understand signs. Had tongue speak, would say That brother I said thee. His napkin, true tears bewet, Can service sorrowful cheeks. O, sympathy woe this, As far help limbo bliss. TITUS O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron! Did ever raven sing like lark, That gives sweet tidings sun's uprise? With heart I'll send Emperor hand. Good Aaron, wilt thou help chop off? TITUS Sirs, strive more. Such withered herbs Are meet plucking up, therefore mine. TITUS Agree you. I spare hand. TITUS Come hither, Aaron. I'll deceive both. Lend thy hand, I give thee mine. TITUS Now stay strife. What shall dispatched.-- Good Aaron, give Majesty hand. Tell hand warded From thousand dangers. Bid bury it. More hath merited; let have. As sons, say I account As jewels purchased easy price, And yet dear, too, I bought mine own. TITUS O, I lift one hand heaven, And bow feeble ruin earth. [He kneels.] If power pities wretched tears, To I call. [(Lavinia kneels.)] What, wouldst thou kneel me? Do, then, dear heart, heaven shall hear prayers, Or sighs we'll breathe welkin dim And stain sun fog, sometime clouds When hug melting bosoms. TITUS Is sorrow deep, bottom? Then passions bottomless them. TITUS If reason miseries, Then limits could I bind woes. When heaven doth weep, doth Earth o'erflow? If winds rage, doth sea wax mad, Threat'ning welkin big-swoll'n face? And wilt thou reason coil? I sea. Hark sighs doth flow! She weeping welkin, I Earth. Then must sea moved sighs; Then must Earth continual tears Become deluge, overflowed drowned, Forwhy bowels cannot hide woes But like drunkard must I vomit them. Then give leave, losers leave To ease stomachs bitter tongues. TITUS When fearful slumber end? TITUS Why, I another tear shed. Besides, sorrow enemy And would usurp upon wat'ry eyes And make blind tributary tears. Then way shall I find Revenge's cave? For two heads seem speak And threat I shall never come bliss Till mischiefs returned Even throats hath committed them. Come, let see task I do. You heavy people, circle That I may turn one And swear unto soul right wrongs. The vow made. Come, brother, take head, And hand I bear.-- And, Lavinia, thou shalt employed arms. Bear thou hand, sweet wench, thy teeth.-- As thee, boy, go get thee sight. Thou art exile, thou must stay. Hie Goths raise army there. And love me, I think do, Let's kiss part, much do. [All Lucius exit.] TITUS So, so. Now sit, look eat Than preserve much strength us As revenge bitter woes ours. Marcus, unknit sorrow-wreathen knot. Thy niece I, poor creatures, want hands And cannot passionate tenfold grief With folded arms. This poor right hand mine Is left tyrannize upon breast, Who, heart, mad misery, Beats hollow prison flesh, Then thus I thump down.-- Thou map woe, thus dost talk signs, When thy poor heart beats outrageous beating, Thou canst strike thus make still. Wound sighing, girl, kill groans; Or get little knife thy teeth And thy heart make thou hole, That tears thy poor eyes let fall May run sink and, soaking in, Drown lamenting fool sea-salt tears. TITUS How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already? Why, Marcus, man mad I. What violent hands lay life? Ah, wherefore dost thou urge name hands, To bid Aeneas tell tale twice o'er How Troy burnt made miserable? O, handle theme, talk hands, Lest remember still none.-- Fie, fie, franticly I square talk, As forget hands If Marcus name word hands! Come, let's fall to, and, gentle girl, eat this. Here drink!--Hark, Marcus, says. I interpret martyred signs. She says drinks drink tears Brewed sorrow, mashed upon cheeks.-- Speechless complainer, I learn thy thought. In thy dumb action I perfect As begging hermits holy prayers. Thou shalt sigh, hold thy stumps heaven, Nor wink, nod, kneel, make sign, But I wrest alphabet And still practice learn know thy meaning. TITUS Peace, tender sapling. Thou art made tears, And tears quickly melt thy life away. [Marcus strikes dish knife.] What dost thou strike at, Marcus, thy knife? TITUS Out thee, murderer! Thou kill'st heart. Mine eyes cloyed view tyranny; A deed death done innocent Becomes Titus' brother. Get thee gone. I see thou art company. TITUS "But"? How fly father mother? How would hang slender gilded wings And buzz lamenting doings air! Poor harmless fly, That, pretty buzzing melody, Came make us merry! And thou hast killed him. TITUS Come, take away.--Lavinia, go me. I'll thy closet go read thee Sad stories chanced times old.-- Come, boy, go me. Thy sight young, And thou shalt read mine begin dazzle. [They exit.] TITUS She loves thee, boy, well thee harm. TITUS Fear not, Lucius. Somewhat doth mean. See, Lucius, see, much makes thee. Somewhither would thee go her. Ah, boy, Cornelia never care Read sons hath read thee Sweet poetry Tully's Orator. TITUS How now, Lavinia?--Marcus, means this? Some book desires see.-- Which it, girl, these?--Open them, boy.-- [To Lavinia.] But thou art deeper read better skilled. Come take choice library, And beguile thy sorrow till heavens Reveal damned contriver deed.-- Why lifts arms sequence thus? TITUS Lucius, book tosseth so? TITUS Soft! So busily turns leaves. Help her! What would find?--Lavinia, shall I read? This tragic tale Philomel, And treats Tereus' treason rape. And rape, I fear, root thy annoy. TITUS Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl, Ravished wronged Philomela was, Forced ruthless, vast, gloomy woods? See, see! Ay, place hunt-- O, never, never hunted there!-- Patterned poet describes, By nature made murders rapes. TITUS Give signs, sweet girl, none friends, What Roman lord durst deed. Or slunk Saturnine, Tarquin erst, That left camp sin Lucrece' bed? TITUS "Stuprum. Chiron, Demetrius." TITUS 'Tis sure enough, knew how. But hunt bearwhelps, beware; The dam wake wind once. She's lion deeply still league, And lulls whilst playeth back; And sleeps list. You young huntsman, Marcus; let alone. And come, I go get leaf brass, And gad steel write words, And lay by. The angry northern wind Will blow sands like Sibyl's leaves abroad, And where's lesson then?--Boy, say you? TITUS Come, go mine armory. Lucius, I'll fit thee, withal boy Shall carry Empress' sons Presents I intend send both. Come, come. Thou 'lt message, wilt thou not? TITUS No, boy, so. I'll teach thee another course.-- Lavinia, come.--Marcus, look house. Lucius I'll go brave court; Ay, marry, we, sir, we'll waited on. [All Marcus exit.] TITUS Come, Marcus, come. Kinsmen, way.-- Sir boy, let see archery. Look draw home enough 'tis straight.-- Terras Astraea reliquit. Be remembered, Marcus, gone, fled.-- Sirs, take tools. You, cousins, shall Go sound ocean cast nets; Happily may catch sea; Yet there's little justice land. No; Publius Sempronius, must it. 'Tis must dig mattock spade, And pierce inmost center Earth. Then, come Pluto's region, I pray you, deliver petition. Tell justice aid, And comes old Andronicus, Shaken sorrows ungrateful Rome. Ah, Rome! Well, well, I made thee miserable What time I threw people's suffrages On thus doth tyrannize o'er me. Go, get gone, pray careful all, And leave man-of-war unsearched. This wicked emperor may shipped hence, And, kinsmen, may go pipe justice. TITUS Publius, now? How now, masters? What, met her? TITUS He doth wrong feed delays. I'll dive burning lake And pull Acheron heels. Marcus, shrubs, cedars we, No big-boned men framed Cyclops' size, But metal, Marcus, steel back, Yet wrung wrongs backs bear; And sith there's justice Earth hell, We solicit heaven move gods To send Justice wreak wrongs. Come, gear. You good archer, Marcus. [He gives arrows.] "Ad Jovem," that's you;--here, "Ad Apollinem";-- "Ad Martem," that's myself;-- Here, boy, "to Pallas";--here, "to Mercury";-- "To Saturn," Caius--not Saturnine! You good shoot wind. To it, boy!--Marcus, loose I bid. Of word, I written effect; There's god left unsolicited. TITUS Now, masters, draw. [(They shoot.)] O, well said, Lucius! Good boy, Virgo's lap! Give Pallas. TITUS Ha, ha! Publius, Publius, hast thou done? See, see, thou hast shot one Taurus' horns! TITUS Why, goes. God give Lordship joy! TITUS Sirrah, come hither. Make ado, But give pigeons Emperor. By thou shalt justice hands. Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money thy charges.--Give pen ink.--Sirrah, grace deliver supplication? [He writes.] TITUS Sirrah, hast thou knife? Come, let see it.-- [He takes knife gives Marcus.] Here, Marcus, fold oration, For thou hast made like humble suppliant.-- And thou hast given Emperor, Knock door tell says. TITUS Who doth molest contemplation? Is trick make ope door, That sad decrees may fly away And study effect? You deceived, I mean do, See here, bloody lines I set down, And written shall executed. TITUS No, word. How I grace talk, Wanting hand give action? Thou hast odds me; therefore, more. TITUS I mad. I know thee well enough. Witness wretched stump; witness crimson lines; Witness trenches made grief care; Witness tiring day heavy night; Witness sorrow I know thee well For proud empress, mighty Tamora. Is thy coming hand? TITUS Art thou Revenge? And art thou sent To torment mine enemies? TITUS Do service ere I come thee. Lo, thy side, Rape Murder stands, Now give surance thou art Revenge: Stab them, tear thy chariot wheels, And I'll come thy wagoner, And whirl along thee globe, Provide thee two proper palfreys, black jet, To hale thy vengeful wagon swift away, And find murderers guilty caves. And thy car loaden heads, I dismount thy wagon wheel Trot like servile footman day long, Even Hyperion's rising east Until downfall sea. And day day I'll heavy task, So thou destroy Rapine Murder there. TITUS Are thy ministers? What called? TITUS Good Lord, like Empress' sons are, And Empress! But worldly men Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes. O sweet Revenge, I come thee, And one arm's embracement content thee, I embrace thee by. [He exits above.] TITUS Long I forlorn, thee. Welcome, dread Fury, woeful house.-- Rapine Murder, welcome too. How like Empress sons are! Well fitted, Moor. Could hell afford devil? For well I wot Empress never wags But company Moor; And, would represent queen aright, It convenient devil. But welcome are. What shall do? TITUS Nay, nay, let Rape Murder stay me, Or else I'll call brother back And cleave revenge Lucius. TITUS I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell. [Tamora exits.] TITUS Tut, I work enough do.-- Publius, come hither; Caius, Valentine. TITUS Fie, Publius, fie, thou art much deceived. The one Murder, Rape other's name; And therefore bind them, gentle Publius. Caius Valentine, lay hands them. Oft heard wish hour, And I find it. Therefore bind sure, And stop mouths begin cry. [Titus exits.] TITUS Come, come, Lavinia. Look, thy foes bound.-- Sirs, stop mouths. Let speak me, But let hear fearful words I utter.-- O villains, Chiron Demetrius! Here stands spring stained mud, This goodly summer winter mixed. You killed husband, vile fault Two brothers condemned death, My hand cut made merry jest, Both sweet hands, tongue, dear Than hands tongue, spotless chastity, Inhuman traitors, constrained forced. What would say I let speak? Villains, shame could beg grace. Hark, wretches, I mean martyr you. This one hand yet left cut throats, Whiles Lavinia 'tween stumps doth hold The basin receives guilty blood. You know mother means feast me, And calls Revenge, thinks mad. Hark, villains, I grind bones dust, And blood I'll make paste, And paste coffin I rear, And make two pasties shameful heads, And bid strumpet, unhallowed dam, Like earth swallow increase. This feast I bid to, And banquet shall surfeit on; For worse Philomel used daughter, And worse Procne I revenged. And prepare throats.--Lavinia, come, Receive blood. [He cuts throats.] And dead, Let go grind bones powder small, And hateful liquor temper it, And paste let vile heads baked. Come, come, everyone officious To make banquet, I wish may prove More stern bloody Centaurs' feast. So. Now bring in, I'll play cook And see ready mother comes. [They exit, carrying dead bodies.] TITUS Welcome, lord;--welcome, dread queen;-- Welcome, warlike Goths;--welcome, Lucius;-- And welcome, all. Although cheer poor, 'Twill fill stomachs. Please eat it. [They begin eat.] TITUS Because I would sure well To entertain Highness empress. TITUS An Highness knew heart, were.-- My lord Emperor, resolve this: Was well done rash Virginius To slay daughter right hand Because enforced, stained, deflowered? TITUS A reason mighty, strong, effectual; A pattern, precedent, lively warrant For me, wretched, perform like. Die, die, Lavinia, thy shame thee, And thy shame thy father's sorrow die. [He kills Lavinia.] TITUS Killed tears made blind. I woeful Virginius was, And thousand times cause To outrage, done. TITUS Will 't please eat?--Will 't please Highness feed? TITUS Not I; 'twas Chiron Demetrius. They ravished cut away tongue, And they, 'twas they, wrong. TITUS Why, are, baked pie, Whereof mother daintily hath fed, Eating flesh hath bred. 'Tis true, 'tis true! Witness knife's sharp point. [He stabs Empress.]
