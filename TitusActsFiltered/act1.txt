 Hail Rome, victorious thy mourning weeds! Lo, bark hath discharged fraught Returns precious lading bay From whence first weighed anchorage, Cometh Andronicus, bound laurel boughs, To resalute country tears, Tears true joy return Rome. Thou great defender Capitol, Stand gracious rites intend. Romans, five-and-twenty valiant sons, Half number King Priam had, Behold poor remains alive dead. These survive let Rome reward love; These I bring unto latest home, With burial amongst ancestors. Here Goths given leave sheathe sword. Titus, unkind careless thine own, Why suffer'st thou thy sons unburied yet To hover dreadful shore Styx? Make way lay brethren. There greet silence, dead wont, And sleep peace, slain country's wars. O sacred receptacle joys, Sweet cell virtue nobility, How many sons hast thou mine store That thou wilt never render more? I give you, noblest survives, The eldest son distressed queen. Patient yourself, madam, pardon me. These brethren Goths beheld Alive dead, brethren slain Religiously ask sacrifice. To son marked, die must, T' appease groaning shadows gone. Let so. And let Andronicus Make latest farewell souls. In peace honor rest here, sons, Rome's readiest champions, repose rest, Secure worldly chances mishaps. Here lurks treason, envy swells, Here grow damned drugs; storms, No noise, silence eternal sleep. In peace honor rest here, sons. Kind Rome, hast thus lovingly reserved The cordial mine age glad heart!-- Lavinia, live, outlive thy father's days And fame's eternal date, virtue's praise. Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus. A better head glorious body fits Than shakes age feebleness. What, I robe trouble you? Be chosen proclamations today, Tomorrow yield rule, resign life, And set abroad new business all? Rome, I thy soldier forty years, And led country's strength successfully, And buried one twenty valiant sons, Knighted field, slain manfully arms, In right service noble country. Give staff honor mine age, But scepter control world. Upright held it, lords, held last. Content thee, prince. I restore thee The people's hearts wean themselves. People Rome, people's tribunes here, I ask voices suffrages. Will bestow friendly Andronicus? Tribunes, I thank you, suit I make: That create emperor's eldest son, Lord Saturnine, whose virtues will, I hope, Reflect Rome Titan's rays Earth And ripen justice commonweal. Then, elect advice, Crown say "Long live emperor." It doth, worthy lord, match I hold highly honored Grace; And sight Rome Saturnine, King commander commonweal, The wide world's emperor, I consecrate My sword, chariot, prisoners, Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord. Receive them, then, tribute I owe, Mine honor's ensigns humbled thy feet. How, sir? Are earnest then, lord? Traitors, avaunt! Where Emperor's guard? Nor thou sons mine. My sons would never dishonor me. Traitor, restore Lavinia Emperor. O monstrous! What reproachful words these? These words razors wounded heart. I bid wait upon bride. Titus, wert thou wont walk alone, Dishonored thus challenged wrongs? No, foolish tribune, no; son mine, Nor thou, confederates deed That hath dishonored family. Unworthy brother unworthy sons! Traitors, away! He rests tomb. This monument five hundred years hath stood, Which I sumptuously reedified. Here none soldiers Rome's servitors Repose fame, none basely slain brawls. Bury can. He comes here. "And shall"? What villain spake word? What, would bury despite? Marcus, even thou hast struck upon crest, And boys mine honor thou hast wounded. My foes I repute every one. So trouble more, get gone. Speak thou more, rest speed. I know not, Marcus, I know is. Whether device no, heavens tell. Is beholding man That brought high good turn far? Yes, nobly remunerate. Prince Bassianus, leave plead deeds. 'Tis thou, those, dishonored me. Rome righteous heavens judge How I loved honored Saturnine. Tomorrow, please Majesty To hunt panther hart me, With horn hound we'll give Grace bonjour.
