 Hear me, grave fathers; noble tribunes, stay. For pity mine age, whose youth spent In dangerous wars whilst securely slept; For blood Rome's great quarrel shed, For frosty nights I watched, And bitter tears see, Filling aged wrinkles cheeks, Be pitiful condemned sons, Whose souls corrupted 'tis thought. For two-and-twenty sons I never wept Because died honor's lofty bed. For these, tribunes, dust I write My heart's deep languor soul's sad tears. Let tears stanch earth's dry appetite. My sons' sweet blood make shame blush. O Earth, I befriend thee rain That shall distil two ancient ruins Than youthful April shall showers. In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still; In winter warm tears I'll melt snow And keep eternal springtime thy face, So thou refuse drink dear sons' blood. Ah, Lucius, thy brothers let plead.-- Grave tribunes, I entreat you-- Why, 'tis matter, man. If hear, They would mark me; mark, They would pity me. Yet plead I must, And bootless unto them. Therefore I tell sorrows stones, Who, though cannot answer distress, Yet sort better Tribunes, For intercept tale. When I weep, humbly feet Receive tears seem weep me, And attired grave weeds, Rome could afford tribunes like these. A stone soft wax, tribunes hard stones; A stone silent offendeth not, And tribunes tongues doom men death. But wherefore stand'st thou thy weapon drawn? Will consume me? Let see it, then. Faint-hearted boy, arise look upon her.-- Speak, Lavinia. What accursed hand Hath made thee handless thy father's sight? What fool hath added water sea Or brought faggot bright-burning Troy? My grief height thou cam'st, And like Nilus disdaineth bounds.-- Give sword. I'll chop hands too, For fought Rome vain; And nursed woe feeding life; In bootless prayer held up, And served effectless use. Now service I require Is one help cut other.-- 'Tis well, Lavinia, thou hast hands, For hands Rome service vain. It dear, wounded Hath hurt killed dead. For I stand one upon rock, Environed wilderness sea, Who marks waxing tide grow wave wave, Expecting ever envious surge Will brinish bowels swallow him. This way death wretched sons gone; Here stands son banished man, And brother, weeping woes. But gives soul greatest spurn Is dear Lavinia, dearer soul. Had I seen thy picture plight It would madded me. What shall I do, Now I behold thy lively body so? Thou hast hands wipe away thy tears, Nor tongue tell hath martyred thee. Thy husband dead, death Thy brothers condemned, dead this.-- Look, Marcus!--Ah, son Lucius, look her! When I name brothers, fresh tears Stood cheeks doth honeydew Upon gathered lily almost withered. If kill thy husband, joyful, Because law hath ta'en revenge them.-- No, no, would foul deed. Witness sorrow sister makes.-- Gentle Lavinia, let kiss thy lips, Or make sign I may thee ease. Shall thy good uncle thy brother Lucius And thou I sit round fountain, Looking downwards behold cheeks, How stained like meadows yet dry With miry slime left flood? And fountain shall gaze long Till fresh taste taken clearness And made brine pit bitter tears? Or shall cut away hands like thine? Or shall bite tongues dumb shows Pass remainder hateful days? What shall do? Let us tongues Plot device misery To make us wondered time come. Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot Thy napkin cannot drink tear mine, For thou, poor man, hast drowned thine own. Mark, Marcus, mark. I understand signs. Had tongue speak, would say That brother I said thee. His napkin, true tears bewet, Can service sorrowful cheeks. O, sympathy woe this, As far help limbo bliss. O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron! Did ever raven sing like lark, That gives sweet tidings sun's uprise? With heart I'll send Emperor hand. Good Aaron, wilt thou help chop off? Sirs, strive more. Such withered herbs Are meet plucking up, therefore mine. Agree you. I spare hand. Come hither, Aaron. I'll deceive both. Lend thy hand, I give thee mine. Now stay strife. What shall dispatched.-- Good Aaron, give Majesty hand. Tell hand warded From thousand dangers. Bid bury it. More hath merited; let have. As sons, say I account As jewels purchased easy price, And yet dear, too, I bought mine own. O, I lift one hand heaven, And bow feeble ruin earth. If power pities wretched tears, To I call. What, wouldst thou kneel me? Do, then, dear heart, heaven shall hear prayers, Or sighs we'll breathe welkin dim And stain sun fog, sometime clouds When hug melting bosoms. Is sorrow deep, bottom? Then passions bottomless them. If reason miseries, Then limits could I bind woes. When heaven doth weep, doth Earth o'erflow? If winds rage, doth sea wax mad, Threat'ning welkin big-swoll'n face? And wilt thou reason coil? I sea. Hark sighs doth flow! She weeping welkin, I Earth. Then must sea moved sighs; Then must Earth continual tears Become deluge, overflowed drowned, Forwhy bowels cannot hide woes But like drunkard must I vomit them. Then give leave, losers leave To ease stomachs bitter tongues. When fearful slumber end? Why, I another tear shed. Besides, sorrow enemy And would usurp upon wat'ry eyes And make blind tributary tears. Then way shall I find Revenge's cave? For two heads seem speak And threat I shall never come bliss Till mischiefs returned Even throats hath committed them. Come, let see task I do. You heavy people, circle That I may turn one And swear unto soul right wrongs. The vow made. Come, brother, take head, And hand I bear.-- And, Lavinia, thou shalt employed arms. Bear thou hand, sweet wench, thy teeth.-- As thee, boy, go get thee sight. Thou art exile, thou must stay. Hie Goths raise army there. And love me, I think do, Let's kiss part, much do. So, so. Now sit, look eat Than preserve much strength us As revenge bitter woes ours. Marcus, unknit sorrow-wreathen knot. Thy niece I, poor creatures, want hands And cannot passionate tenfold grief With folded arms. This poor right hand mine Is left tyrannize upon breast, Who, heart, mad misery, Beats hollow prison flesh, Then thus I thump down.-- Thou map woe, thus dost talk signs, When thy poor heart beats outrageous beating, Thou canst strike thus make still. Wound sighing, girl, kill groans; Or get little knife thy teeth And thy heart make thou hole, That tears thy poor eyes let fall May run sink and, soaking in, Drown lamenting fool sea-salt tears. How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already? Why, Marcus, man mad I. What violent hands lay life? Ah, wherefore dost thou urge name hands, To bid Aeneas tell tale twice o'er How Troy burnt made miserable? O, handle theme, talk hands, Lest remember still none.-- Fie, fie, franticly I square talk, As forget hands If Marcus name word hands! Come, let's fall to, and, gentle girl, eat this. Here drink!--Hark, Marcus, says. I interpret martyred signs. She says drinks drink tears Brewed sorrow, mashed upon cheeks.-- Speechless complainer, I learn thy thought. In thy dumb action I perfect As begging hermits holy prayers. Thou shalt sigh, hold thy stumps heaven, Nor wink, nod, kneel, make sign, But I wrest alphabet And still practice learn know thy meaning. Peace, tender sapling. Thou art made tears, And tears quickly melt thy life away. What dost thou strike at, Marcus, thy knife? Out thee, murderer! Thou kill'st heart. Mine eyes cloyed view tyranny; A deed death done innocent Becomes Titus' brother. Get thee gone. I see thou art company. "But"? How fly father mother? How would hang slender gilded wings And buzz lamenting doings air! Poor harmless fly, That, pretty buzzing melody, Came make us merry! And thou hast killed him. Come, take away.--Lavinia, go me. I'll thy closet go read thee Sad stories chanced times old.-- Come, boy, go me. Thy sight young, And thou shalt read mine begin dazzle.
