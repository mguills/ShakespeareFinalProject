 She loves thee, boy, well thee harm. Fear not, Lucius. Somewhat doth mean. See, Lucius, see, much makes thee. Somewhither would thee go her. Ah, boy, Cornelia never care Read sons hath read thee Sweet poetry Tully's Orator. How now, Lavinia?--Marcus, means this? Some book desires see.-- Which it, girl, these?--Open them, boy.-- But thou art deeper read better skilled. Come take choice library, And beguile thy sorrow till heavens Reveal damned contriver deed.-- Why lifts arms sequence thus? Lucius, book tosseth so? Soft! So busily turns leaves. Help her! What would find?--Lavinia, shall I read? This tragic tale Philomel, And treats Tereus' treason rape. And rape, I fear, root thy annoy. Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl, Ravished wronged Philomela was, Forced ruthless, vast, gloomy woods? See, see! Ay, place hunt-- O, never, never hunted there!-- Patterned poet describes, By nature made murders rapes. Give signs, sweet girl, none friends, What Roman lord durst deed. Or slunk Saturnine, Tarquin erst, That left camp sin Lucrece' bed? "Stuprum. Chiron, Demetrius." 'Tis sure enough, knew how. But hunt bearwhelps, beware; The dam wake wind once. She's lion deeply still league, And lulls whilst playeth back; And sleeps list. You young huntsman, Marcus; let alone. And come, I go get leaf brass, And gad steel write words, And lay by. The angry northern wind Will blow sands like Sibyl's leaves abroad, And where's lesson then?--Boy, say you? Come, go mine armory. Lucius, I'll fit thee, withal boy Shall carry Empress' sons Presents I intend send both. Come, come. Thou 'lt message, wilt thou not? No, boy, so. I'll teach thee another course.-- Lavinia, come.--Marcus, look house. Lucius I'll go brave court; Ay, marry, we, sir, we'll waited on. Come, Marcus, come. Kinsmen, way.-- Sir boy, let see archery. Look draw home enough 'tis straight.-- Terras Astraea reliquit. Be remembered, Marcus, gone, fled.-- Sirs, take tools. You, cousins, shall Go sound ocean cast nets; Happily may catch sea; Yet there's little justice land. No; Publius Sempronius, must it. 'Tis must dig mattock spade, And pierce inmost center Earth. Then, come Pluto's region, I pray you, deliver petition. Tell justice aid, And comes old Andronicus, Shaken sorrows ungrateful Rome. Ah, Rome! Well, well, I made thee miserable What time I threw people's suffrages On thus doth tyrannize o'er me. Go, get gone, pray careful all, And leave man-of-war unsearched. This wicked emperor may shipped hence, And, kinsmen, may go pipe justice. Publius, now? How now, masters? What, met her? He doth wrong feed delays. I'll dive burning lake And pull Acheron heels. Marcus, shrubs, cedars we, No big-boned men framed Cyclops' size, But metal, Marcus, steel back, Yet wrung wrongs backs bear; And sith there's justice Earth hell, We solicit heaven move gods To send Justice wreak wrongs. Come, gear. You good archer, Marcus. "Ad Jovem," that's you;--here, "Ad Apollinem";-- "Ad Martem," that's myself;-- Here, boy, "to Pallas";--here, "to Mercury";-- "To Saturn," Caius--not Saturnine! You good shoot wind. To it, boy!--Marcus, loose I bid. Of word, I written effect; There's god left unsolicited. Now, masters, draw. O, well said, Lucius! Good boy, Virgo's lap! Give Pallas. Ha, ha! Publius, Publius, hast thou done? See, see, thou hast shot one Taurus' horns! Why, goes. God give Lordship joy! Sirrah, come hither. Make ado, But give pigeons Emperor. By thou shalt justice hands. Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money thy charges.--Give pen ink.--Sirrah, grace deliver supplication? Sirrah, hast thou knife? Come, let see it.-- Here, Marcus, fold oration, For thou hast made like humble suppliant.-- And thou hast given Emperor, Knock door tell says.
