Art thou Revenge? And art thou sent To torment mine enemies? Do service ere I come thee. Lo, thy side, Rape Murder stands, Now give surance thou art Revenge: Stab them, tear thy chariot wheels, And I'll come thy wagoner, And whirl along thee globe, Provide thee two proper palfreys, black jet, To hale thy vengeful wagon swift away, And find murderers guilty caves. And thy car loaden heads, I dismount thy wagon wheel Trot like servile footman day long, Even Hyperion's rising east Until downfall sea. And day day I'll heavy task, So thou destroy Rapine Murder there. Are thy ministers? What called? Good Lord, like Empress' sons are, And Empress! But worldly men Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes. O sweet Revenge, I come thee, And one arm's embracement content thee, I embrace thee by. Long I forlorn, thee. Welcome, dread Fury, woeful house.-- Rapine Murder, welcome too. How like Empress sons are! Well fitted, Moor. Could hell afford devil? For well I wot Empress never wags But company Moor; And, would represent queen aright, It convenient devil. But welcome are.

Let speak me, But let hear fearful words I utter.-- O villains, Chiron Demetrius! Here stands spring stained mud, This goodly summer winter mixed. You killed husband, vile fault Two brothers condemned death, My hand cut made merry jest, Both sweet hands, tongue, dear Than hands tongue, spotless chastity, Inhuman traitors, constrained forced. What would say I let speak? Villains, shame could beg grace. Hark, wretches, I mean martyr you. This one hand yet left cut throats, Whiles Lavinia 'tween stumps doth hold The basin receives guilty blood. You know mother means feast me, And calls Revenge, thinks mad. Hark, villains, I grind bones dust, And blood I'll make paste, And paste coffin I rear, And make two pasties shameful heads, And bid strumpet, unhallowed dam, Like earth swallow increase. This feast I bid to, And banquet shall surfeit on; For worse Philomel used daughter, And worse Procne I revenged. And prepare throats.--Lavinia, come, Receive blood. And dead, Let go grind bones powder small, And hateful liquor temper it, And paste let vile heads baked. Come, come, everyone officious To make banquet, I wish may prove More stern bloody Centaurs' feast. So. Now bring in, I'll play cook And see ready mother comes.

A reason mighty, strong, effectual; A pattern, precedent, lively warrant For me, wretched, perform like. Die, die, Lavinia, thy shame thee, And thy shame thy father's sorrow die. Killed tears made blind. I woeful Virginius was, And thousand times cause To outrage, done. Will 't please eat?--Will 't please Highness feed? Not I; 'twas Chiron Demetrius. They ravished cut away tongue, And they, 'twas they, wrong. Why, are, baked pie, Whereof mother daintily hath fed, Eating flesh hath bred. 'Tis true, 'tis true! Witness knife's sharp point.
