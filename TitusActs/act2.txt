TITUS
The hunt is up, the moon is bright and gray,
The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green.
Uncouple here, and let us make a bay
And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,
And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter's peal,
That all the court may echo with the noise.
Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
To attend the Emperor's person carefully.
I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.

TITUS
Many good morrows to your Majesty;--
Madam, to you as many, and as good.--
I promised your Grace a hunter's peal.

TITUS
And I have horse will follow where the game
Makes way and runs like swallows o'er the plain.

TITUS
I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail,
For by my father's reverend tomb I vow
They shall be ready at your Highness' will
To answer their suspicion with their lives.
