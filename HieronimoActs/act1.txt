HIERONIMO: Long may he live to serve my Sovereign Liege,
And soon decay, unless he serve my Liege.

HIERONIMO: That was my son, my gracious sovereign,
Of whom, though from his tender infancy
My loving thoughts did never hope but well,
He never pleased his father's eyes til now,
Nor filled my heart with over-cloying joys. ... 

HIERONIMO: But that I know your Grace for just and wise,
And might seem partial in this difference,
Enforced by nature and by law of arms
My tongue should plead for young Horatio's right.
He hunted well that was a lion's death, ... 
Not he that in a garment wore his skin;
So Hares may pull dead lions by the beard.

HIERONIMO: The first armed knight, that hung his Scutcheon up,
Was English Robert, Earl of Gloucester,
Who, when King Stephen bore sway in Albion,
Arrived with five and twenty thousand men
In Portingale, and by success of war
Enforced the King, then but a Saracen, ... 
To bear the yoke of the English monarchy.

HIERONIMO: The second knight that hung his Scutcheon up,
Was Edmund, Earl of Kent in Albion,
When English Richard wore the diadem.
He came likewise and razed Lisbon walls
And took the King of Portingale in fight; ... 
For which and other such-like service done,
He after was created Duke of York.

HIERONIMO: The third and last, not least in our account
Was, as the rest, a valiant Englishman,
Brave John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster,
As by his Scutcheon plainly may appear. ... 
He with a puissant army came to Spain,
And took our King of Castile prisoner.
